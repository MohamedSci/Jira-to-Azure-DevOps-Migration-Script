400 Status Code Error Occurs When Printing Cash Receipt Report Despite Successful Download

h4. *Description:*

When a user selects the *From Date* and *To Date* in the *Cash Receipt Report* screen and clicks the *Print* button, a *400 Bad Request error* appears in the network console. However, the report is still downloaded successfully. This error may indicate an *incorrect API request* or *unnecessary validation issues*.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system.
* The *Cash Receipt Report* module is accessible.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance Module > Reports > Cash Receipt Report*.
# Select a valid *From Date* and *To Date* in the date filters.
# Click the *Print* button.
# Observe the network logs in the browser's developer console (*F12 > Network tab*).

h4. *Expected Result:*

* The *report should be printed/downloaded successfully* without any *error messages*.
* No *400 status code* should be logged in the network console.
* If there is an issue with the request, a *clear validation or error message* should be displayed to the user.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* The report is *successfully downloaded*.
* However, the network console logs a *400 Bad Request error*.
* No *informational message* is shown to the user regarding the error.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Investigate *why the request is returning a 400 error* even though the report is being downloaded.
* Ensure that the *API request for printing* is correctly formatted and *does not contain invalid parameters*.
* If the request is expected to fail under certain conditions, show a *clear validation message* to the user instead of silently logging an error.

h4. *Severity:*

? *Medium* ? The report is still downloaded, but the error might indicate deeper API or validation issues that could cause failures in the future.","[semob83188@maonyn.com|mailto:semob83188@maonyn.com]

h4. *Description:*

When navigating to the *Cash Receipt Report* module, the report automatically displays and loads data *without requiring any user-selected filters*. This can lead to *incorrect or unintended data being displayed*, potentially exposing unnecessary financial information.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system.
* The *Cash Receipt Report* module is accessible.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance Module > Reports > Cash Receipt Report*.
# Observe that the report *immediately loads and displays data* without requiring any filter selection.

h4. *Expected Result:*

* The report should *not load or display any data* unless the user selects the *required filters (e.g., date range, payment method, account, etc.)*.
* Instead, an *informational message* should appear, prompting the user to *apply filters before displaying data*.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* The report *automatically displays data* upon navigation *without any user input*.
* This behavior may lead to *unintended data visibility issues* and can *impact performance* due to unnecessary data loading.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Prevent the report from automatically displaying data upon navigation.
* Implement a *filter requirement*, ensuring that users *must select at least one filter* before retrieving report data.
* Display an *informational message*: _""Please select filters before generating the report.""_

When the user selects a *day* from the *calendar widget* and clicks once, the selected date is correctly *inputted in the label*, but the system *still displays a required validation message* incorrectly. However, when the user *clicks the same date twice*, the validation message does *not* appear unnecessarily. This behavior causes *user confusion* as the field appears valid but is still flagged as required.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system.
* A date input field with a *calendar widget* is available.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to thein [Cash Payment Report|https://ibrahimmohamed.microtecdev.com:2050/finance/reports/cash-payment-report]
# Click the calendar  *date input field* to open the *date picker*.
# Select *any day* and click it *once*.
# Observe that the *date is displayed in the field*, but a required validation message appears.
# Click the same date *twice*.
# Observe that the validation message disappears.

h4. *Expected Result:*

* *After a single click*, the system should recognize the selected date and *not display the required validation message*.
* The validation message should *only* appear if the user attempts to submit the form *without selecting a date*.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* After *one click*, the date is set correctly, but the required validation message *is incorrectly displayed*.
* After *two clicks*, the validation message *disappears*, even though the selection was already valid after the first click.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Ensure the *validation check* properly detects that a date is selected *after one click*.
* Remove any *unnecessary validation triggers* when the user selects a date.
* Test the date picker behavior to ensure *consistent input handling*.

h4. *Severity:*

? *Medium* ? Causes *user confusion* but does not block form submission.","[semob83188@maonyn.com|mailto:semob83188@maonyn.com]

Printing Cash Payment Receipt Without Input Data Returns a 400 Error Without Informational Message

h4. *Description:*

When the user clicks the *Print* button on the *Cash Payment Receipt* screen *without selecting or inputting any data*, the system triggers a *400 Bad Request error* in the network. Additionally, the API request *incorrectly includes a* {{payment method}} *query parameter*, even though no valid input was provided. The system does not display an *informational message* to inform the user about the missing required data.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system with appropriate access.
* The *Cash Payment Receipt* module is accessible.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance Module ? Transactions ? Cash Payment Receipt*.
# Do *not* select or input any required data (e.g., Payment Details, Amount, Payment Method).
# Click the *Print* button.
# Observe the system behavior and network logs.

h4. *Expected Result:*

* The system should *not trigger a 400 error*.
* An *informational message* should be displayed:
_""Please enter the required details before printing the payment receipt.""_
* The *API request should not include invalid query parameters (e.g.,* {{payment method}}*)* when no input is provided.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* A *400 Bad Request* error is triggered in the network log.
* The request includes an incorrect {{payment method}} parameter despite no input.
* No validation message is displayed, leaving the user without guidance.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* *Implement validation* to prevent the print action if required fields are empty.
* Display a *clear informational message* before attempting to send the request.

However, inspecting the *Network Log (Developer Tools ? Network Tab)* reveals a *400 Bad Request* error for the print API request. This issue suggests that while the report is being generated and downloaded, there is an incorrect or unnecessary request that results in an error.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system with the necessary permissions.
* The *required fields* for report generation are correctly filled.
* The *View* button is clicked to generate the report.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the relevant *reporting screen*.
# Fill in all required fields with *valid* input.
# Click the *View* button to generate the report.
# Once the report is displayed, click the *Print* button.
# Observe the *report successfully downloading*.
# Open *Developer Tools (F12) ? Network Tab*.
# Notice that a *400 Bad Request* error appears in the network log for the print request.

h4. *Expected Result:*

* The *Print* button should trigger a *valid API request* without errors.
* No *400 Bad Request* error should appear in the network log.
* The report should *download successfully* without unnecessary failed requests.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* The report *successfully downloads*, but a *400 Bad Request* error appears in the network log.
* This may indicate *an incorrect API request being made*, possibly with missing or invalid parameters.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Investigate why an *invalid API request* is being made when clicking the Print button.
* Ensure the request parameters are correctly formatted before sending the print API request.
* Prevent unnecessary or duplicate API calls that may lead to errors.
* Implement error handling to *log and ignore failed requests* if they do not impact functionality.

h4. *Severity:*

?? *Medium* ? The report successfully downloads, but the error may indicate *underlying issues* that could cause future failures.","[semob83188@maonyn.com|mailto:semob83188@maonyn.com]

Print Button Generates Blank Print View When No Filters Are Applied

h4. *Description:*

On the *Payment Reconciliation Report* screen, when the user clicks the *Print* button without applying any filters or selecting a customer, the system *generates an empty print preview* instead of displaying a proper validation message. This can mislead users into thinking there is an issue with the report.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the *Payment Reconciliation Report* module.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance Module ? Reports ? Payment Reconciliation Report*.
# Do *not* apply any filters or select a customer.
# Click the *Print* button.
# Observe that an *empty print preview* is generated with no data.

h4. *Expected Result:*

* If no filters are applied and no data is available, the system should display an *informative message*, such as:
_""No data available for printing. Please apply filters and try again.""_
* The Print button should be *disabled* until valid data is available for printing.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* The system *generates an empty print preview* with no warning or validation message.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Implement a *validation check* before generating the print view.
* Display a *clear message* when no data is available.
* Disable the *Print button* until at least one filter is applied or relevant data is retrieved.

h4. *Preconditions:*

On the *Payment Reconciliation Report* screen, when a user selects a customer, the report *does not display* the invoices that have been *successfully reconciled*. Instead, the *Select Invoice* dropdown incorrectly shows *only non-reconciled invoices*, preventing users from accessing reconciliation details. This issue affects financial reporting accuracy and reconciliation tracking.

* The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the *Payment Reconciliation Report* module.
* At least one invoice has been successfully reconciled for the selected customer.

# Navigate to *Finance Module ? Reports ? Payment Reconciliation Report*.
# Select a *customer* who has reconciled invoices.
# Open the *Select Invoice* dropdown.
# Observe that the dropdown *only lists non-reconciled invoices* instead of displaying reconciled ones.
# Attempt to generate a reconciliation report and notice that *no data appears* for reconciled invoices.

Users face issues when uploading attachments in journal entry. Sometimes, the uploaded image does not appear, while other times it uploads successfully. Additionally, after saving an entry and start creating a new one, the previous attachment remains instead of resetting.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the *Accounting Module*.
#  Transaction => Journal entry => create and upload an attachment.
# Observe that the attachment *sometimes does not appear* after uploading.
# If the attachment appears, save the transaction.
# Start a *new transaction* and check the attachment section.

* The attachment *randomly fails to appear* after uploading.
* After saving and starting a *new transaction*, the *previous attachment is still displayed*, instead of resetting.

* The attachment should *always appear* after uploading successfully.
* When starting a *new transaction*, the attachment field should be *cleared* instead of retaining the previous file.",,Hossam Saad,,,,712020:3c22f450-e7ae-4ff2-8b71-8bed4f50793f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ME-3223,,,,,,,,,,02/Mar/25 3:06 PM;712020:3c22f450-e7ae-4ff2-8b71-8bed4f50793f;1.mp4;https://microtec.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/16256,02/Mar/25 3:06 PM;712020:3c22f450-e7ae-4ff2-8b71-8bed4f50793f;2.mp4;https://microtec.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/16257,,,,,,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@619536a5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0|i01ktn:,,,,,,,,,,ME Sprint 24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To Do,3/2/2025 15:16

Negative Amounts Can Be Entered and Saved in Payment In Screen Without Validation

h4. *Description:*

On the *Add Payment In* screen, the *Amount* field in the *Detail Section* allows users to enter negative values. The system successfully *saves and posts* the transaction without any validation or error message. This issue leads to severe inconsistencies in *financial calculations, reconciliation, and related module transactions*, affecting overall system accuracy.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system with permission to create and post *Payment In* transactions.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance Module ? Transactions ? Add Payment In* screen.
# In the *Detail Section*, enter a *negative amount* (e.g., {{-1000}}).
# Click *Save*, then *Post* the transaction.
# Observe that the system allows the transaction to be saved and posted without validation.
# Check the related financial reports, reconciliation, and transaction history to see discrepancies.

h4. *Expected Result:*

* The system should *not allow* negative values in the *Amount* field.
* If a negative value is entered, an *error message* should be displayed, preventing the user from saving or posting the transaction.
* Proper validation should be enforced to ensure only positive values are accepted.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* The system allows negative amounts in the *Amount* field.
* The transaction is successfully saved and posted without any validation.
* This leads to financial calculation errors in *balancing, reconciliation, and other dependent modules*.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Implement *validation* to restrict negative values in the *Amount* field.
* Display a clear *error message* when a negative value is entered.
* Prevent transactions with negative amounts from being saved or posted.
* Conduct a *system-wide audit* to check if similar validation issues exist in other financial modules.

h4. *Severity:*

?? *Critical* ? This issue impacts financial accuracy, reconciliation, and balance calculations, leading to serious financial discrepancies.","[semob83188@maonyn.com|mailto:semob83188@maonyn.com]

Search Functionality Fails in the Advanced Search Dialog for Selecting an Account Across Multiple ERP Modules

h4. *Description:*

In multiple modules of the ERP system, including *Treasury Definition, Bank Definition, Payment In, and Payment Out*, the *Advanced Search (Select Account)* dialog does not filter results when the user enters a search term. This issue prevents users from efficiently finding and selecting an account, leading to delays and poor user experience.

h4. *Affected Modules:*

* Treasury Definition Add/Edit
* Bank Definition Add/Edit
* Payment In Add/Edit
* Payment Out Add/Edit

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system with appropriate access to the affected modules.
* The system contains existing accounts available for selection.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to any of the affected modules (e.g., *Treasury Definition Add/Edit*).
# Click on the *Select Account* field to open the *Advanced Search Dialog*.
# In the search input field, type an account name or account code.
# Observe that no filtering or search results appear based on the entered query.

h4. *Expected Result:*

* As the user types in the search field, the system should dynamically filter and display relevant account results.
* The search should support filtering based on *account name* or *account code*.
* If no results match the search term, an appropriate *""No results found""* message should be displayed.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* The search input does not trigger any filtering of the account list.
* The full list of accounts remains unchanged, even when entering a search term.
* Users are unable to efficiently locate specific accounts, leading to a poor user experience.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Ensure that the search input field triggers a request to filter the accounts dynamically.
* Validate whether *API requests* for search functionality are being made correctly.
* Implement *debouncing* to prevent excessive search requests.
* Ensure that the search function considers both *account name* and *account code*.
* Display an appropriate message when no matching results are found.

h4. *Severity:*

*High* ? The inability to search for accounts across multiple modules significantly impacts user workflow and system efficiency.","[semob83188@maonyn.com|mailto:semob83188@maonyn.com]

Incorrect icon for the Print button, incorrect order of action buttons, and missing tooltips in the Fund Transfer List View.

----

h4. *Description:*

In the *Fund Transfer List View*, the following issues are observed:

# The *Print* button has the same icon as the *View* button, causing confusion for users.
# The order of the action buttons (e.g., View, Edit, Delete, Print) is not correct or consistent with the application's design standards.
# No tooltips are displayed when hovering over the action buttons, making it difficult for users to understand their functionality.

These issues affect the usability and user experience of the Fund Transfer List View.

----

h4. *Precondition:*

# The user is logged in with the necessary permissions.
# The *Fund Transfer List View* is accessible.
# At least one Fund Transfer record exists in the system.

----

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance Module > Transaction Submenu > Fund Transfer*.
# Observe the action buttons (e.g., View, Edit, Delete, Print) in the List View.
# Hover over each action button to check for tooltips.
# Click on the *Print* button and observe its icon.
# Verify the order of the action buttons.

----

h4. *Expected Result:*

# The *Print* button should have a distinct icon (e.g., a printer icon) that differentiates it from the *View* button.
# The action buttons should be displayed in a logical and consistent order (e.g., View, Edit, Delete, Print).
# Tooltips should appear when hovering over each action button, describing their functionality (e.g., ""View,"" ""Edit,"" ""Delete,"" ""Print"").

----

h4. *Actual Result:*

# The *Print* button has the same icon as the *View* button, causing confusion.
# The order of the action buttons is incorrect or inconsistent.
# No tooltips are displayed when hovering over the action buttons.

----

h4. *Impact:*

* Users may accidentally click the wrong button due to the incorrect icon and lack of tooltips.
* The inconsistent button order and missing tooltips reduce the usability and user experience of the Fund Transfer List View.
* This issue may lead to user frustration and errors in navigating the system.

----

h4. *Severity:*

*Medium* ? This is a usability issue that affects the user experience but does not prevent core functionality from working.

----

h4. *Priority:*

*High* ? The issues need to be addressed to improve usability and align with the application's design standards.","[semob83188@maonyn.com|mailto:semob83188@maonyn.com]

Non-descriptive error message displayed in a pop-up when selecting a Bank account with an invalid payment method.

----

h4. *Description:*

When a user selects a *Bank account* that has a payment method other than *Transfer* (e.g., Visa or Span) in the *Fund Transfer Add* screen, a non-descriptive error message is displayed in a pop-up at the bottom layer. The message reads:
*""Error you can't select bank without payment method.""*

This message is not informative, does not guide the user to resolve the issue, and appears in an incorrect view (pop-up at the bottom layer). According to the business rules, only Bank accounts with the *Transfer* payment method should be selectable for Fund Transfers.

----

h4. *Precondition:*

# The user is logged in with the necessary permissions.
# The *Fund Transfer Add* screen is accessible.
# At least one Bank account exists in the system with a payment method other than *Transfer* (e.g., Visa or Span).

----

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance Module > Transaction Submenu > Fund Transfer*.
# Click on the *Add* button to open the Fund Transfer Add screen.
# In the *Send From* section:
#* Select *Bank* in the *Payment Hub* field.
#* In the *Payment Hub Details* field, select a Bank account that has a payment method other than *Transfer* (e.g., Visa or Span).
# Observe the system behavior.

----

h4. *Expected Result:*

* The system should display a *clear and informative error message* in the correct view (e.g., near the *Payment Hub Details* field or in a modal dialog).
* The error message should guide the user to select a Bank account with the *Transfer* payment method.
* Example of an informative message:
*""Invalid Payment Method: Please select a Bank account with the 'Transfer' payment method.""*

----

h4. *Actual Result:*

* A non-descriptive error message is displayed in a pop-up at the bottom layer:
*""Error you can't select bank without payment method.""*
* The message does not specify the issue or guide the user to resolve it.
* The pop-up appears in an incorrect view (bottom layer), making it less noticeable.

----

h4. *Impact:*

* Users are confused by the non-descriptive error message and may not understand how to resolve the issue.
* The incorrect placement of the pop-up (bottom layer) makes it easy to miss, leading to frustration and delays in completing the transaction.
* This issue affects the user experience and may result in incorrect data entry or abandoned transactions.

----

h4. *Severity:*

*Medium* ? This is a usability issue that impacts the user experience but does not prevent the core functionality from working.

----

h4. *Priority:*

*High* ? The error message needs to be improved to ensure users can complete their tasks efficiently.

----

h4. *Attachments:*

# Screenshot of the non-descriptive error message in the pop-up.
# Screenshot of the Fund Transfer Add screen with the selected Bank account.
# Logs or additional error details from the system.

----

h4. *Root Cause Analysis (If Available):*

The issue occurs because:

# The system allows the selection of Bank accounts with payment methods other than *Transfer*, even though the business rules specify that only *Transfer* is acceptable.
# The error message is hardcoded and does not provide sufficient context or guidance.
# The pop-up is displayed in an incorrect view (bottom layer), making it less noticeable and user-friendly.

----

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

# *Validation Rule:*
#* Update the system to filter and display only Bank accounts with the *Transfer* payment method in the *Payment Hub Details* dropdown.
#* If a Bank account with an invalid payment method is selected, prevent the selection and display an informative error message in the correct view.
# *Error Message:*
#* Replace the non-descriptive message with a clear and informative one, such as:
#*""Invalid Payment Method: Please select a Bank account with the 'Transfer' payment method.""*
# *UI/UX Improvement:*
#* Display the error message near the *Payment Hub Details* field or in a modal dialog for better visibility.
#* Ensure the message is displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g., red text with an icon).","[semob83188@maonyn.com|mailto:semob83188@maonyn.com]

*High* ? This is a critical functionality issue that prevents users from performing essential financial transactions.

----

h4. *Priority:*

*Urgent* ? This issue needs immediate attention as it affects core functionality.

----

h4. *Attachments:*

# Screenshot of the error message in the network log.
# Screenshot of the Fund Transfer Add screen with the entered data.
# Logs or additional error details from the server.

----

h4. *Root Cause Analysis (If Available):*

The error message suggests that the issue occurs while saving the entity changes. The inner exception (not visible in the logs) may provide more details about the specific cause. Possible causes include:

* A mismatch between the payment methods (Transfer and Cash) during the transaction processing.
* A database constraint or validation rule that is not being handled correctly.
* An issue with the entity mapping or data persistence logic.

----

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

# Investigate the inner exception details to identify the exact cause of the error.
# Ensure that the system handles the combination of *Transfer* (Bank) and *Cash* (Treasury) payment methods correctly.
# Validate the entity mapping and database constraints to ensure they align with the business rules.
# Add proper error handling and user-friendly messages to guide users in case of similar issues.

----

h4. *Additional Notes:*

* This issue should be tested in the development environment before deploying to production.
* Regression testing should be performed to ensure that other Fund Transfer scenarios (e.g., Bank to Bank, Treasury to Treasury) are not affected.

Save Button Successfully Saves Reconciliation but Does Not Redirect or Reset the Screen

h4. *Description:*

On the *Payment Reconciliation* screen in the *Finance App*, after clicking the *Save* button, the reconciliation is successfully saved, and a *success popup* is displayed. However, the screen remains stuck, and all manipulated fields still retain the same data and state instead of refreshing or redirecting. This creates confusion for users as they are unsure whether the reconciliation has been processed correctly.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the *Finance App*.
* The user has navigated to *Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Reconciliation*.
* A customer and a payment have been selected.
* One or more invoices have been selected for reconciliation.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Reconciliation*.
# Select a customer from the *Customer Selection* popup.
# Select a payment from the *Payment Selection* popup.
# Choose one or more invoices for reconciliation.
# Click the *Reconcile* button to apply the payment.
# Click the *Save* button.
# Observe that the reconciliation is successfully saved, and a *success popup* appears.
# Notice that the screen does not refresh or redirect, and the fields still show the same data.

h4. *Expected Result:*

* After successful reconciliation, the screen should either:
** Redirect the user to the *Payment Reconciliation List* screen.
** Refresh and reset the fields to their default state.
* The previously reconciled invoices should no longer appear as pending reconciliation.
* The UI should provide a *clear indication* that the process has been completed.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* The *Save* button successfully saves the reconciliation and displays a success popup.
* The screen remains unchanged with all manipulated fields retaining the same data.
* Users are unsure whether the reconciliation was actually processed.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Implement a *screen refresh or redirection* after successful reconciliation.
* Automatically *reset all fields* and update the invoice list to reflect the reconciliation.
* Ensure that reconciled invoices are *removed from the pending list*.
* Provide a clear confirmation message indicating that the process is complete and that no further action is required.

h4. *Severity:*

*Medium-High* ? The issue does not prevent reconciliation but causes confusion and inefficiency for users.","[semob83188@maonyn.com|mailto:semob83188@maonyn.com]

Cancel Button is Not Functioning on the Payment Reconciliation Screen

h4. *Description:*

On the *Payment Reconciliation* screen in the *Finance App*, the *Cancel* button is not actionable when a user attempts to cancel a reconciliation action. As a result, users cannot revert any unsaved changes, leading to potential errors and requiring manual reloading of the page.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the *Finance App*.
* The user has navigated to *Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Reconciliation*.
* A customer and a payment have been selected.
* One or more invoices have been selected for reconciliation.

# Click the *Cancel* button to discard the reconciliation action.

h4. *Expected Result:*

* The *Cancel* button should successfully revert any unsaved reconciliation actions.
* The *invoice list* and *payment allocation* should return to their previous state.
* A *confirmation prompt* should appear (if applicable), asking the user to confirm cancellation.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* The *Cancel* button is not actionable (clicking it does not trigger any response).
* Unsaved reconciliation changes remain on the screen.
* Users are forced to *reload the page manually* to undo changes.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Ensure the *Cancel* button is correctly bound to a function that reverts changes.
* Implement a *confirmation popup* to confirm the cancellation of actions.
* Ensure that unsaved changes are discarded, and the original state is restored.

Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing

----

*Description:*
The search functionality does not efficiently handle user input, causing an excessive number of requests to be sent to the server. Each time the user types a character, a request is immediately triggered, even if the time between keystrokes is less than one second. This can lead to server overload, performance issues, and unnecessary network traffic. Implementing *debouncing* should optimize the search behavior.

----

*Precondition:*

* The ERP system is accessible, and the user has access to the search feature.

----

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in to the ERP system.
# Navigate to a screen where the search functionality is available.
# Start typing a search term letter by letter.
# Observe that each keystroke triggers a request without waiting for a pause in typing.

----

*Expected Result:*

* The search functionality should implement *debouncing*, meaning it waits for a short delay (e.g., 500?800ms) after the user stops typing before sending a request.
* This reduces unnecessary server requests and improves performance.

----

*Actual Result:*

* A request is sent for every character typed, even if the delay between keystrokes is very short.
* This causes excessive API calls, leading to increased server load and potential performance degradation.

----

*Suggested Fix:*

* Implement *Debouncing* in the search functionality to delay API requests until the user has stopped typing for a defined period (e.g., 500?800ms).","[semob83188@maonyn.com|mailto:semob83188@maonyn.com]

h4. *Issue Description:*

When the user attempts to *return items* using the *""Return Purchase Invoice"" Add* screen and saves the transaction without posting it, they are unable to create another return transaction for the same invoice.

On the second attempt to return items from the same invoice, clicking the *Save* button *does nothing*, and the *network log* shows an error with *Status Code 500*.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Return Purchase Invoice Add* screen.
# Select a *Purchase Invoice* to return items from.
# Fill in all *required data* and return *each item's available quantity*.
# Click *Save* (but do not post the transaction).
# Open the *Return Purchase Invoice Add* screen again and select the *same invoice*.
# Fill in all *required data* and attempt to *return the items again*.
# Click *Save* and observe that *nothing happens*.
# Check the *network log*, which shows *HTTP 500 Internal Server Error*.

h4. *Expected Behavior:*

* The system should *display an informative message* if there is an *unposted* return transaction related to the same Purchase Invoice.
* The message should guide the user to either *post* or *cancel* the pending return before proceeding with a new one.
* The system should *not fail silently*, and it should prevent the user from facing an unexpected error.

h4. *Actual Behavior:*

* When the user attempts to save a second *Return Purchase Invoice* for the same invoice:
** Clicking the *Save* button does *nothing*.
** The *network log* shows an *HTTP 500 Internal Server Error*.
** No error message is displayed to the user, leaving them confused.

h4. 

h4. *Impact:*

* Prevents users from *processing valid returns*.
* Causes *confusion* due to the lack of an error message.
* Results in *system instability* (HTTP 500 errors).
* Affects the *accuracy of purchase return records*.

h4. *Severity:* *High*

This issue blocks users from completing return transactions, affecting inventory accuracy and financial records.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Implement *validation logic* to check if an *unposted return transaction* exists for the selected *Purchase Invoice*.
* Display a *clear error message* before saving, such as:
*""There is an unposted return transaction related to this Purchase Invoice. Please post or cancel it before creating a new one.""*
* Ensure that the system *does not trigger a 500 error* and handles this scenario gracefully.","[https://intmicrotec.com:2006/bussiness-owners/|https://intmicrotec.com:2006/bussiness-owners/]

This prevents the user from proceeding, despite the discount being valid.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the *Purchase Invoice Add* screen.
# Select a *Warehouse* and add items.
# Input a *discount amount* that is less than the item's cost.
# Input *Cost* and *discount amount* as Decimal Numbers.
# Observe that the system *incorrectly displays* the error:
#* *""Amount Exceeds the Price in RowRow3""*

h4. *Expected Behavior:*

* The system should only display the *""Amount Exceeds the Price""* error if the discount entered *exceeds* the item cost.
* If the discount is valid (i.e., *less than or equal to the item cost*), the system should allow the user to proceed without displaying an error.

h4. *Actual Behavior:*

* The error appears *incorrectly* even when the discount amount is valid.
* The user is unable to save the *Purchase Invoice* because of the incorrect validation.

h4. *Issue Description:*

When the user clicks the *Help* button on any screen, the system navigates to the Help Pages. However, the following issues occur:

# *No Return to Previous Screen:* There is no option to return back to the previous screen from the Help Pages.
# *Incorrect Back Navigation Behavior:* If the user manually navigates back, it returns to the parent-related Help Pages instead of the previous screen.
# *Side Menu Displays Incorrect Options:* The side menu incorrectly displays *General Settings* module options instead of maintaining the context of the previously accessed screen.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to any module or transaction screen (e.g., Sales Invoice, Purchase Order, etc.).
# Click on the *Help* button.
# Observe that the system navigates to the *Help Pages* instead of opening in a new tab.
# Attempt to navigate back using the browser back button.
# Notice that it does not return to the previous screen but instead loads parent-related help pages.
# Observe the side menu displaying *General Settings* instead of the relevant module options.

h4. *Expected Behavior:*

* The Help Page should open in a *new window* or *new tab* instead of redirecting the user from the current screen.
* If the Help Page is opened in the same window, a *clear return option* should be provided to navigate back to the previously accessed screen.
* The side menu should remain consistent with the user's previously selected module / App, not default to General Settings.

h4. *Actual Behavior:*

* The system redirects the user away from their current work screen when they click the Help button.
* There is no direct way to return to the screen where the user clicked the Help button.
* The side menu shows *General Settings* options instead of the appropriate module.

h4. *Impact:*

* Interrupts user workflow as they lose their place in the system.
* Causes confusion due to incorrect navigation and missing return functionality.
* Leads to inefficiency since users have to manually navigate back to the intended module.

h4. *Severity:* *Medium to High*

This issue affects usability and navigation across all modules, causing disruptions in user experience.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Modify the Help Button functionality to *open the Help Pages in a new tab or window* instead of navigating away.
* Ensure that if the Help Page opens in the same window, there is a *Return to Previous Page* button.
* Maintain the side menu context based on the user's current module instead of defaulting to General Settings.","[https://intmicrotec.com:2006/bussiness-owners/|https://intmicrotec.com:2006/bussiness-owners/]

h4. *Bug Description*

When a user *clicks the Save button multiple times* in the *Stock In Add Screen*, multiple stock-in records are generated instead of a *single entry*. This leads to *duplicate stock entries*, which can cause inventory discrepancies and incorrect stock levels.

# Navigate to the *Stock In Add* screen.
# Fill in all *required fields* (Warehouse, Items, Quantities, etc.).
# Click the *Save* button multiple times rapidly.
# Observe that multiple *Stock In* records are created instead of one.

Unexpected Stock Increase When Posting a Purchase Invoice Multiple Times

*Description:*
In the *Purchase Invoice* screen of the Purchase App, an unexpected behavior occurs when posting an invoice. Each time the user clicks the *Post* button, the item's stock quantity increases. This issue is visible in the *Item Card Report* and the *Stock Out Add Screen* under the *Item Availability* field. However, the *Purchase Invoice List View* correctly shows only one posted purchase invoice, and the *Stock In* screen reflects only one *Posted Stock In* entry from the purchase.

----

h3. *Precondition:*

* User is logged into the Purchase App.
* The user has access to the *Purchase Invoice* module.
* At least one *item* exists in the inventory.

h3. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the *Purchase Invoice* screen.
# Fill in all required fields, including *Supplier, Date, and Item Details*.
# Add an *item* with a valid quantity.
# Click *Save* to create the purchase invoice.
# Click *Post* button *Multiple* time to finalize the purchase invoice.
# Observe the *Item Card Report* and *Stock Out Add Screen (Item Availability field)* ? stock increases.
# Observe that the stock quantity increases again, even though only one purchase invoice is recorded in the *List View* and *Stock In Screen*.

----

h3. *Expected Result:*

* The system should prevent multiple postings of the same *Purchase Invoice*.
* Clicking *Post* multiple times should not result in duplicate stock increases.
* Stock quantity updates should match the actual *Posted Purchase Invoice* count.
* If the invoice is already posted, the system should display an error message like:
_""This Purchase Invoice has already been posted. No further stock updates are required.""_

h3. *Actual Result:*

* Clicking the *Post* button multiple times increases the stock quantity incorrectly.
* The *Item Card Report* and *Stock Out Add Screen* reflect inflated stock values.
* The *Purchase Invoice List View* and *Stock In Screen* correctly show only one posted invoice.

----

h3. *Severity:*

*Critical* ? Leads to incorrect stock levels, impacting inventory management and financial reporting.

Missing Column Filtering Functionality in the 'Return Purchase Invoice' List View

*Description:*
In the *Return Purchase Invoice* list view screen of the Purchase App, the system does not provide column filtering functionality.

h3. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the *Return Purchase Invoice* list view.
# Observe the available columns (e.g., Invoice Number, Supplier, Date, Status).
# Try to apply a filter for any column (e.g., filter by a specific *Vendor Name* or *Invoice Number*).
# Notice that no filtering option is available.

----

h3. *Expected Result:*

* The list view should provide a *column filtering* functionality, allowing users to filter invoices based on attributes such as:
** *Invoice Number*
** *Vensor Name*
** *Return Date*
** *Status* (e.g., Pending, Posted, Canceled)
* Users should be able to enter search values or select from dropdowns where applicable.

----

h3. *Actual Result:*

* No *column filtering* functionality is available.
* Users must manually search for invoices, making it difficult to locate specific records.

System Allows Posting 'Return Purchase Invoice' with a Date Before the 'Purchase Invoice' Date

*Description:*
In the Purchase App, the system allows users to post a *Return Purchase Invoice* with a date that is earlier than the original *Purchase Invoice* date. This leads to logical inconsistencies in financial records, as an invoice return should not precede the purchase itself.

*Precondition:*

* User is logged into the Purchase App.
* User has access to the 'Return Purchase Invoice' functionality.
* A valid *Purchase Invoice* exists in the system.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the *Return Purchase Invoice* Add Screen.
# Select an existing *Purchase Invoice* from the list.
# Enter a *Return Purchase Invoice Date* that is earlier than the selected *Purchase Invoice Date*.
# Click on the *Post* button to submit the return invoice.

*Expected Result:*

* The system should validate the *Return Purchase Invoice Date* and prevent posting if it is earlier than the corresponding *Purchase Invoice Date*.
* An appropriate error message should be displayed, such as:
_""Return Purchase Invoice date cannot be earlier than the original Purchase Invoice date.""_

*Actual Result:*

* The system accepts and posts the *Return Purchase Invoice* even if its date is before the *Purchase Invoice Date*.
* This results in an illogical transaction where a return occurs before the purchase.","[https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/|https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/]

This leads to an issue where users can delete an item line from the selected invoice. Once deleted, the item detail is lost, preventing further manipulation or recovery of the item in the return process.

*Precondition:*

* User is logged into the Purchase App.
* User has access to the 'Return Purchase Invoice' functionality.
* A purchase invoice exists with multiple items listed.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the 'Return Purchase Invoice' Add Screen.
# Select an invoice from the invoice list.
# Observe that all items from the selected invoice are displayed in the Items Table section.
# Notice the *Delete* action button is present for each item row.
# Click on the *Delete* button for any item in the list.
# The item is removed from the table, and the user is unable to reselect or manipulate the item again.

*Expected Result:*

* The *Delete* action should not be available in the Items Table section of the 'Return Purchase Invoice' Add Screen.
* Items listed under the selected invoice should remain intact to prevent accidental deletion.
* Users should be able to manage and manipulate all items without losing them unintentionally.

*Actual Result:*

* The *Delete* action button is available in the Items Table section.
* Users can delete an item from the list.
* Once an item is deleted, it cannot be recovered or manipulated in the return process.","[https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/|https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/]

System Accepts Discount Amount Greater Than Cost in Purchase Invoice but Displays Incorrect Validation After Save and Post

*Description:*
When a user inputs a discount amount greater than the cost in the Purchase Invoice, the system allows this value to be entered. However, upon clicking the ""Save"" button, a descriptive validation message appears, prompting the user to correct the discount amount. Once the user clears the greater discount and enters a valid value, the transaction is saved successfully. But when the user clicks the ""Post"" button, an undescriptive validation message is displayed with network error messages such as ""Cost must be positive"" and ""Quantity must be positive."" This behavior indicates that the system either does not correctly clear cache or does not respond properly to changes in field values.

*Precondition:*

* User is logged into the ERP system.
* The user is on the Purchase Invoice screen.
* The discount amount is entered as greater than the cost.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the Purchase app > Purchase Invoice.
# Enter all required fields for the purchase invoice.
# Click Add new Line to add new item
# Select Items from the Dropdown and input valid Quantity and Cost
# Input a discount amount that is greater than the item cost.
# Click the ""Save"" button.
# A descriptive validation message is shown indicating the discount amount is greater than the cost.
# Correct the discount amount to a valid value and click the ""Save"" button again. The transaction is saved successfully.
# Click the ""Post"" button to try to post the transaction.

*Expected Result:*

* The discount amount should not be allowed to exceed the cost value in the first place.
* After inputting valid values and saving the transaction, the post operation should succeed without any validation errors.

*Actual Result:*

* The system allows the discount amount to exceed the cost.
* After saving, the user receives a validation message that prompts them to adjust the discount amount.
* After entering a valid discount and saving the transaction, the user encounters an undescriptive validation message when trying to post the transaction.
* The network error messages include ""Cost must be positive"" and ""Quantity must be positive,"" even though the data appears to be correct.
* The system does not correctly clear cache or respond properly to field value changes, causing the undescriptive error.","[https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/|https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/]

System Allows Deletion of Tax Groups Assigned to Tax Definitions

----

*Description:*
The system incorrectly permits the deletion of tax groups that are already assigned to tax definitions. This behavior can lead to broken references, data inconsistencies, and operational issues when processing taxes within the system.

----

*Precondition:*

* The ERP system is accessible, and the user is logged in with permissions to manage tax groups and tax definitions.
* A tax group is assigned to one or more tax definitions.

----

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in to the ERP system.
# Navigate to the General Settings APP >>> *Tax Group* screen.
# Identify a tax group that is assigned to one or more tax definitions.
# Attempt to delete the tax group.

----

*Expected Result:*
The system should prevent deletion of tax groups that are assigned to tax definitions, displaying a validation error message such as:

* ""This tax group cannot be deleted as it is assigned to active tax definitions.""

----

*Actual Result:*
The system allows deletion of tax groups that are assigned to tax definitions without any validation, resulting in:

* Broken references in the associated tax definitions.
* Inability to process taxes that rely on the deleted tax group.","[https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/|https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/]

# An infinite loading circular progress bar is displayed in the foreground (top layer).
# No data is saved, and the user cannot proceed.

# Log in to the ERP system.
# Navigate to the *Customer Definition Add* form.
# Fill in all required fields in the form.
# Ensure there is no open financial year in the system.
# Click the *""Save""* button.

----

*Expected Result:*
A clear and actionable message should be displayed, such as:

* Informing the user that no financial year is open.
* Providing a button or option to resolve the issue (e.g., open a financial year or contact admin).
The save operation should not trigger an infinite loading state.

----

*Actual Result:*

* A ""Open Financial Year"" popup appears in the background (bottom layer).
* An infinite circular progress bar is displayed in the foreground (top layer), making the system appear stuck.

Localization Issues in Column Headers of Exported PDF/Excel Reports

*Description:*
When generating PDF or Excel reports through the export functionality, the column headers are not localized and appear in the default language (e.g., English) instead of the selected language or localization settings configured by the user. This behavior leads to inconsistencies between the system's display language and the exported report content.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in to the system and change the language or localization settings to a non-default language (e.g., Arabic, English, etc.).
# Navigate to any module that supports export functionality (e.g., Treasury).
# Generate a report by clicking the *Export to PDF* or *Export to Excel* button.
# Open the exported report and observe the column headers.

*Expected Result:*

* The column headers in the exported PDF/Excel reports should reflect the language and localization settings selected by the user.

*Actual Result:*

Export Button Does Not Display Informative Message When List View Is Empty

*Description:*
When the *Export* button is clicked in a list view that has no data (i.e., the list is empty), the system performs no action and does not display any informative message to the user. This behavior creates confusion as users are unaware that the export operation cannot proceed due to the absence of data.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to a list view in the module where the *Export* functionality is available.
# Ensure the list view is empty (e.g., by applying filters that return no results or by having no saved data).
# Click the *Export* button.

*Expected Result:*

* The system should display an informative message, such as:
_""No data available to export. Please ensure there are records in the list view before attempting to export.""_
* The export operation should be prevented when the list view is empty.

*Actual Result:*

* No action is performed upon clicking the *Export* button.
* No message or feedback is provided to inform the user about the empty list view.

Column Filtering in Select JL Account Advanced Dialog Allows User to Select Account Without Viewing Details

*Description:*
In the *Select JL Account Advanced Dialog*, accessed via the *Edit Treasury* dialog, the column filtering functionality allows users to uncheck all columns except the *Actions* column. This behavior makes it possible for users to select a JL account without being able to view its corresponding details or information, leading to confusion and potential data integrity issues.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the *Treasury List View*.
# Select a treasury and open the *Edit Treasury* dialog.
# Click the *Advanced Search* icon for the JL Account field to open the *Select JL Account Advanced Dialog*.
# Use the column filtering options to uncheck all columns except the *Actions* column.
# Attempt to select a JL account without viewing its details.

*Expected Result:*

* Users should not be able to uncheck all essential columns that display critical information (e.g., account name, Code, or description).
* A validation mechanism should ensure that key columns remain visible to prevent ambiguous or uninformed account selection.

*Actual Result:*

* The *Actions* column remains the only visible column after unchecking all other columns.
* Users can select a JL account without seeing any additional details or information about the account.

Treasury Statement Fails to Display Opening Balance for Treasuries with No Transactions

*Description:*
When a user generates a *Treasury Statement* for a treasury with no transactions and applies a valid date range using the *From Date* and *To Date* filters, the opening balance is not displayed. Additionally, no informative message is shown to indicate the absence of transactions or opening balance, which creates confusion for the user.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the *Treasury Statement* screen.
# Select a treasury with no transactions recorded.
# Set a valid *From Date* and *To Date* filter.
# Click on the *Generate Report* button.
# Observe the generated statement.

*Expected Result:*

* The Treasury Statement should display the opening balance, even if no transactions are present during the selected date range.
* If the treasury has no opening balance or transactions, the system should display an informative message such as:
""No transactions available for the selected date range. The opening balance is [0 or X amount].""

*Actual Result:*

* The Treasury Statement does not display any opening balance.
* No informative message is provided, leaving the user uncertain about the state of the treasury.

*Description:*
Both the *Add Invoice* and *Invoice Payment* screens are missing a field that displays the *Tax Label* and the *Applied Tax* value. This missing information prevents users from clearly seeing the tax applied to the invoice, leading to confusion and potential errors in payment processing.

*Precondition:*

# The user is on the *Add Invoice* or *Invoice Payment* screen.
# The invoice includes taxable items, and tax has been applied.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in to the admin portal as an authorized user.

# Create or load an invoice that includes taxable items.
# Check for the field displaying the *Tax Label* and *Applied Tax* value.

# There should be a clear and visible field on both screens displaying the *Tax Label* (e.g., ""VAT"") and the *Applied Tax* value (e.g., ""15%"").
# The field should reflect the correct tax value applied to the invoice based on the taxable items.

*Actual Result:*

# The field with the *Tax Label* and *Applied Tax* value is missing on both the *Add Invoice* and *Invoice Payment* screens.

System enables multiple success payment operations upon repeated clicks of ""Proceed to Offline Payment"" and ""Proceed to Online Payment"" Buttons

*Description:*
When the user clicks the *""Proceed to Offline Payment""* button, the system displays a success confirmation message. However, the *Invoice Payment* screen remains open with the *""Proceed to Offline Payment""* and *""Proceed to Online Payment""* buttons still actionable. This allows users to repeatedly perform the payment operation, resulting in multiple success confirmation messages and potentially duplicate payments.

*Precondition:*

# The user is on the *Invoice Payment* screen with an unpaid invoice.
# Both *""Proceed to Offline Payment""* and *""Proceed to Online Payment""* buttons are enabled.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in to the admin portal as a user.
# Navigate to the *Invoice Payment* screen.
# Click the *""Proceed to Offline Payment""* button.
# Observe the success confirmation message.
# From the *Invoice Payment* screen and click the *""Proceed to Offline Payment""* button again.
# Repeat the process and observe multiple success confirmation messages.
# From the *Invoice Payment* screen and click the *""Proceed to Online Payment""* button.
# Complete Payment process with Correct Visa information.

*Expected Result:*

# After a successful offline payment, the system should disable the *""Proceed to Offline Payment""* and *""Proceed to Online Payment""* buttons for the invoice.
# The user should be redirected to a confirmation page or the payment screen should update to reflect the payment status (e.g., marked as paid).
# Multiple payment operations should be prevented for the same invoice.

*Actual Result:*

# The success confirmation message is displayed after each click on the *""Proceed to Offline Payment""* button.
# The *Invoice Payment* screen remains open, with both payment buttons still actionable.
# Multiple success payment operations are allowed, causing confusion and potential duplicate payments.","[https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/admin-portal/|https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/admin-portal/]

Missing descriptive validation error when clicking ""Proceed to Offline Payment"" with an incorrectly formatted password

*Description:*
When clicking the *""Proceed to Offline Payment""* button, if the user inputs a password that does not match the required format, no clear or descriptive validation error is displayed. This leaves the user unaware of why the action cannot proceed, despite all other required fields being filled correctly.

*Precondition:*

# The user is on the *Offline Payment* screen.
# All required fields are correctly filled, except the password field, which contains an invalid format.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in to the admin portal as a user.
# Navigate to the *Offline Payment* screen.
# Fill in all required fields with valid inputs except for the password, which should not meet the format requirements (e.g., missing special characters or required length).
# Click the *""Proceed to Offline Payment""* button.
# Observe the validation behavior and error message (if any).

*Expected Result:*
A clear and descriptive validation error should appear, indicating the exact password format requirements (e.g., ""Password must be at least 8 characters long and include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters."").

*Actual Result:*
No clear or descriptive validation error is displayed. The user cannot proceed but is not informed of the reason, leading to confusion.","[https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/admin-portal/|https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/admin-portal/]

App Checkboxes Not Clearly Visible in Invoice Creation Process

*Description:*
When the admin creates an invoice, the checkboxes for selecting apps are not clearly visible. This may result in the admin unintentionally missing some app selections, causing those apps to be excluded from the invoice. Consequently, the Preview Invoice and the confirmation email (""Complete your Registration"") do not reflect the correct app costs, leading to incorrect invoice totals and missing cost breakdowns.

h3. *Precondition:*

* The admin user has access to the admin portal.
* Apps are available for selection with prices greater than 0.

# Log in to the admin portal as an admin user.
# Navigate to *Business Owners > Select A Business Owner > Click Add Invoice Icon Button*.
# Attempt to select all available apps from the list (observe the visibility of checkboxes).
# Generate the invoice and preview it.
# Submit the invoice and verify the confirmation email (""Complete your Registration"").

----

h3. *Expected Result:*

# The checkboxes for app selection should be clearly visible and actionable.
# The Preview Invoice should accurately display the selected apps and their associated costs.
# The confirmation email should include a detailed cost breakdown and the correct total.

h3. *Actual Result:*

# Checkboxes for app selection are faint or blend into the background, making them difficult to identify.
# Some apps may not be selected due to checkbox visibility issues, resulting in missing costs in the Preview Invoice.

*Severity:* Medium

----

*Issue Description:*
The *Branches List View* in the ERP system displays several *design inconsistencies* and *misaligned components*, leading to poor user experience and visual clutter. This affects the usability and readability of the branch data.

----

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Branch Management* or *Organization Setup*.
# Open the *Branches List View*.
# Observe the table structure, row alignment, column headers, and spacing between elements.

----

*Expected Behavior:*

* Column headers and table rows should be *aligned properly*.
* Adequate spacing and padding should be applied for *clear readability*.
* Design should follow the *standard table/list view design* used across the ERP system.

*Actual Behavior:*

* The Activate / Deactivate Text is not centered in its containing component
* Uneven padding between rows, leading to a *cluttered view*.
* *Extra margins* between sections, causing unnecessary white space.
* Some elements overlap or appear *out of grid alignment*.
* *Filter/search bar* misalignment with inconsistent spacing from the list table.

h4. *Description:*

When a user applies a filter in any List view and navigates through different pages using the paginator, the system fails to retain the applied filter. As a result, the filter resets, and the user is presented with unfiltered data upon returning to the List view.

h4. *Precondition:*

# The user has access to a List view with a filter and a paginator implemented.
# A filter has been applied to narrow down the displayed data.

----

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to a List view (Payment In List View).
# Apply a filter (e.g., filtering by ""Status: Posted"").
# Use the paginator to move to another page (e.g., Page 2).
# Another way change the Maximum Count to be Displayed in the Page.
# Return to the original page or refresh the List view.

----

h4. *Expected Result:*

The applied filter should persist across different pages, and the List view should continue displaying filtered data regardless of navigation or refresh.

----

h4. *Actual Result:*

The filter resets when navigating through the paginator or refreshing the List view, and unfiltered data is displayed instead.","loginUrl:[https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/|https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/]

*Severity:* High

----

*Issue Description:*
The form dialog used across the ERP system for creating new records (e.g., treasury creation) or selecting items from advanced search *does not display a scrollbar* when the form contains numerous vertical components. This results in the *inability to access and operate elements positioned at the bottom* of the dialog, preventing users from completing the form or saving the data.

----

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to  Stock In.
# click Create button to open the Add Screen
# go to the table in the bottom, and Click Advanced Search Icon in the Item Code Cell
# Observe the lack of a scrollbar and the inability to reach the bottom components.

----

*Expected Behavior:*

* A *scrollbar should appear* when the dialog's content exceeds the visible area.
* Users should be able to *scroll vertically* to access and operate all components.
* Form submission should be possible without obstruction.

*Actual Behavior:*

* No scrollbar is present in dialogs with excessive vertical content.
* Components at the bottom of the form are *inaccessible and unresponsive*.
* Users cannot complete or submit forms, leading to operational blocks.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the *Purchase Invoice* module.

* Users should be able to filter by *Invoice Number, Vendor, Date, Amount, or Status* directly from the list view.

*Actual Behavior:*

* No column filtering options are available.
* Users must manually scroll through records or use the general search, which is inefficient for large datasets.","loginUrl:[https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/|https://intmicrotec.neat-url.com:2006/bussiness-owners/]

----

h3. *Description*:

The current implementation of the Show/Hide column functionality allows users to uncheck critical descriptive columns, such as ""Code"" and ""Name."" This results in the inability to identify records, leading to operational inefficiencies and potential errors when performing actions like editing or deleting records.

----

h3. *Steps to Reproduce*:

# Navigate to a grid (e.g., Business Owner List or Invoice List) with the Show/Hide column option.
# Click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" button.
# Uncheck essential descriptive columns like ""Code"" or ""Name.""
# Observe that the grid no longer displays identifying information for each row, but the ""Action"" column (View/Edit/Delete) remains active.

----

h3. *Expected Result*:

* *Critical descriptive columns (e.g., ""Code,"" ""Name"") should be fixed and unchangeable.*
* *Users should not be able to uncheck these columns.*
* *If the user attempts to uncheck them, a validation message should appear:*
*""Essential descriptive columns cannot be hidden to preserve record identification.""*

----

h3. *Actual Result*:

* Descriptive columns are unchecked without restriction.
* The grid displays rows with only the ""Action"" column, making it impossible to distinguish records.

# Observe that the modules do not respond or navigate to the respective screens.

----

*Expected Behavior:*

* Module options in the Collapsed side slider should be clickable and hoverable, allowing users to navigate to different ERP sections regardless of the language setting.

*Actual Behavior:*

----

* *Description*:
The current user interface exhibits several design and usability issues:
*# *Font Size*:
*#* The font size of field hints and button labels is too small, making it difficult for users to read comfortably.
*# *Vertical Spacing*:
*#* There is insufficient vertical spacing between the header and sub-header, resulting in a crowded appearance.
*# *Language Directionality*:
*#* When the language is switched to Arabic, the font directionality remains *LTR (left-to-right)* instead of *RTL (right-to-left)*, which is inconsistent with Arabic text conventions.

----

* *Preconditions*:
** The user accesses a screen with fields, buttons, headers, and sub-headers.
** The user changes the system language to Arabic.

----

* *Steps to Reproduce*:
*# Open any screen with input fields, buttons, headers, and sub-headers.
*# Observe the font size of field hints and button labels.
*# Observe the spacing between the header and sub-header.
*# Switch the language to *Arabic* in the system settings.
*# Observe the font directionality after the language change.

----

* *Expected Results*:
*# *Font Size*:
*#* Field hints and button labels should have a font size that ensures readability and accessibility.
*# *Vertical Spacing*:
*#* There should be adequate vertical spacing between the header and sub-header to enhance visual clarity and alignment.
*# *Language Directionality*:
*#* When switching to Arabic, the text directionality should automatically change to *RTL* to align with Arabic language norms.

----

* *Actual Results*:
*# *Font Size*:
*#* Field hints and button labels are rendered with a small font size, making them hard to read.
*# *Vertical Spacing*:
*#* Insufficient spacing between the header and sub-header creates a visually cramped layout.
*# *Language Directionality*:
*#* Text remains *LTR* when the language is switched to Arabic, causing inconsistency and usability issues for Arabic-speaking users.

----

* *Description*:
The newly implemented login screen of the Microtec ERP has several design flaws that impact the professionalism and user perception of the system. The percentage value displayed for ""Sales Growth"" is unreasonably low at *45%*, which can negatively affect user morale. Additionally, the image depicting an employee using the system features a *young boy in casual attire*, which does not align with the formal and professional tone expected for an ERP system catering to business environments.

----

* *Issues Identified*:
*# *Percentage Display*:
*#* The ""Sales Growth"" percentage is set at *45%*, which gives the impression of poor performance. This value should either reflect realistic, customizable data or be removed if irrelevant.
*# *Image of Employee*:
*#* The login screen features a *young boy in casual clothing*, which is unprofessional for a corporate ERP system. The image should be replaced with a representation of a professional employee in formal attire to align with the target audience and business context.

----

* *Preconditions*:
*# The user is presented with the login screen of the Microtec ERP.
*# The design elements (percentage growth, background image) are visible on the screen.

----

* *Steps to Reproduce*:
*# Navigate to the *Microtec ERP Login Screen*.
*# Observe the ""Sales Growth"" percentage displayed.
*# Observe the image of the employee featured on the login screen.

----

* *Expected Result*:
** The login screen should maintain a *professional and motivating appearance* with:
*** An appropriate sales growth percentage or no percentage if not required.
*** A formal image of an employee in professional attire.

----

* *Actual Result*:
** The ""Sales Growth"" percentage is set at a low and discouraging value of *45%*.
** The featured employee image is unprofessional, showing a young boy in casual clothing.","Mail: [Sagik32046@Sablecc.Com|mailto:Sagik32046@Sablecc.Com]
