__Title:*
400 Status Code Error Occurs When Printing Cash Receipt Report Despite Successful Download
__Description:*
When a user selects the _From Date_ and _To Date_ in the _Cash Receipt Report_ screen and clicks the _Print_ button, a _400 Bad Request error_ appears in the network console. However, the report is still downloaded successfully. This error may indicate an _incorrect API request_ or _unnecessary validation issues_.
__Preconditions:*
* The user is logged into the ERP system.
_ The _Cash Receipt Report* module is accessible.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module > Reports > Cash Receipt Report_.
- Select a valid _From Date_ and _To Date_ in the date filters.
- Click the _Print_ button.
- Observe the network logs in the browser's developer console (_F12 > Network tab_).
__Expected Result:*
_ The _report should be printed/downloaded successfully_ without any _error messages*.
_ No _400 status code* should be logged in the network console.
_ If there is an issue with the request, a _clear validation or error message* should be displayed to the user.
__Actual Result:*
_ The report is _successfully downloaded*.
_ However, the network console logs a _400 Bad Request error*.
_ No _informational message* is shown to the user regarding the error.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Investigate _why the request is returning a 400 error* even though the report is being downloaded.
_ Ensure that the _API request for printing_ is correctly formatted and _does not contain invalid parameters*.
_ If the request is expected to fail under certain conditions, show a _clear validation message* to the user instead of silently logging an error.
__Severity:*
? _Medium_ ? The report is still downloaded, but the error might indicate deeper API or validation issues that could cause failures in the future.

__Title:*
Cash Receipt Report Automatically Displays Data Upon Navigation Without Applying Any Filters
__Description:*
When navigating to the _Cash Receipt Report_ module, the report automatically displays and loads data _without requiring any user-selected filters_. This can lead to _incorrect or unintended data being displayed_, potentially exposing unnecessary financial information.
__Preconditions:*
* The user is logged into the ERP system.
_ The _Cash Receipt Report* module is accessible.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module > Reports > Cash Receipt Report_.
- Observe that the report _immediately loads and displays data_ without requiring any filter selection.
__Expected Result:*
_ The report should _not load or display any data_ unless the user selects the _required filters (e.g., date range, payment method, account, etc.)*.
_ Instead, an _informational message_ should appear, prompting the user to _apply filters before displaying data*.
__Actual Result:*
_ The report _automatically displays data_ upon navigation _without any user input*.
_ This behavior may lead to _unintended data visibility issues_ and can _impact performance* due to unnecessary data loading.
__Suggested Fix:*
* Prevent the report from automatically displaying data upon navigation.
_ Implement a _filter requirement_, ensuring that users _must select at least one filter* before retrieving report data.
_ Display an _informational message*: _""Please select filters before generating the report.""_
__Severity:*
? _Medium_ ? Could lead to unnecessary data exposure and performance inefficiencies.

__Title:*
Cash Payment Report Uses a Single Date Input for ""From"" and ""To"" Dates, Causing Inconsistencies and Validation Issues
__Description:*
The _Cash Payment Report_ screen allows users to filter reports using a _date range_; however, it only provides a _single date input field with one calendar_ to select both the _""From"" and ""To"" dates_. This implementation leads to _inconsistencies_ in user input and causes the system to display _unwanted required validation messages_, making it difficult to generate reports correctly.

__Description:*
When the user selects a _day_ from the _calendar widget_ and clicks once, the selected date is correctly _inputted in the label_, but the system _still displays a required validation message_ incorrectly. However, when the user _clicks the same date twice_, the validation message does _not_ appear unnecessarily. This behavior causes _user confusion_ as the field appears valid but is still flagged as required.
__Preconditions:*
* The user is logged into the ERP system.
_ A date input field with a _calendar widget* is available.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to thein [Cash Payment Report|https://ibrahimmohamed.microtecdev.com:2050/finance/reports/cash-payment-report]
- Click the calendar  _date input field_ to open the _date picker_.
- Select _any day_ and click it _once_.
- Observe that the _date is displayed in the field_, but a required validation message appears.
- Click the same date _twice_.
- Observe that the validation message disappears.
__Expected Result:*
_ _After a single click_, the system should recognize the selected date and _not display the required validation message*.
_ The validation message should _only_ appear if the user attempts to submit the form _without selecting a date*.
__Actual Result:*
_ After _one click_, the date is set correctly, but the required validation message _is incorrectly displayed*.
_ After _two clicks_, the validation message _disappears*, even though the selection was already valid after the first click.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Ensure the _validation check_ properly detects that a date is selected _after one click*.
_ Remove any _unnecessary validation triggers* when the user selects a date.
_ Test the date picker behavior to ensure _consistent input handling*.
__Severity:*
? _Medium_ ? Causes _user confusion_ but does not block form submission.

Upon investigation in the browser _Developer Tools (Network Tab)_, the API request for printing returns a _404 Not Found_ error, indicating a broken API endpoint or incorrect URL mapping.
__Preconditions:*
* The user is logged into the ERP system with the necessary permissions.
_ There are existing _Payment Out* transactions in the list view.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Out List View_.
- Select an existing _Payment Out_ transaction.
- Click the _Print_ action button.
- Observe that _no print preview or action is triggered_.
- Open the _Developer Tools (F12) ? Network Tab_ and review the print API request.
- Notice that the request _returns a 404 Not Found_ error.
__Expected Result:*
_ The system should successfully generate a _print preview_ for the selected _Payment Out* transaction.
* The API request should return a valid response with the formatted print data.
_ If the API endpoint is missing or incorrect, the system should display a _meaningful error message* instead of failing silently.
__Actual Result:*
_ Clicking the _Print* button does nothing.
_ The API request fails with a _404 Not Found* error.
* No feedback or error message is displayed to the user.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ _Verify and correct* the API endpoint used for printing Payment Out transactions.
_ Ensure that the _correct URL* is mapped in the backend API.
_ Implement _error handling* to inform the user when the print action fails.
* Add logging to capture and report failed API requests for debugging purposes.
__Severity:*
?? _Critical_ ? This issue prevents users from printing Payment Out transactions, which may impact financial operations and reporting.

Print Button Generates Blank Print View When No Filters Are Applied
__Description:*
On the _Payment Reconciliation Report_ screen, when the user clicks the _Print_ button without applying any filters or selecting a customer, the system _generates an empty print preview_ instead of displaying a proper validation message. This can mislead users into thinking there is an issue with the report.
__Preconditions:*
_ The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the _Payment Reconciliation Report* module.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module ? Reports ? Payment Reconciliation Report_.
- Do _not_ apply any filters or select a customer.
- Click the _Print_ button.
- Observe that an _empty print preview_ is generated with no data.
__Expected Result:*
_ If no filters are applied and no data is available, the system should display an _informative message*, such as:

_ The Print button should be _disabled* until valid data is available for printing.

__Title:*
Duplicate Print Buttons in Payment Reconciliation Report Perform the Same Action
__Description:*
On the _Payment Reconciliation Report_ screen, there are _two Print buttons_, both of which _navigate to the same print function_ and execute the same action. This redundancy creates confusion for users and leads to unnecessary UI clutter.
__Preconditions:*
_ The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the _Payment Reconciliation Report* module.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module ? Reports ? Payment Reconciliation Report_.
- Observe that there are _two Print buttons_ on the screen.
- Click the first _Print_ button and note that it generates the reconciliation report print preview.
- Click the second _Print_ button and observe that it performs the _exact same action_ as the first one.
__Expected Result:*
_ There should be _only one Print button* to avoid redundancy.
_ If multiple print options are needed (e.g., _detailed vs. summary reports_), they should be _clearly labeled* to indicate their function.
__Actual Result:*
_ There are _two identical Print buttons_, both triggering the _same print action*.
_ This creates _UI confusion_ and _unnecessary duplication*.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Remove the _duplicate Print button*.
_ If different print functionalities are needed, label them clearly (e.g., _Print Detailed Report_ vs. _Print Summary Report*).
* Conduct a UI review to ensure no similar redundancies exist in other modules.

Bug,(SP24): Payment Reconciliation Report Does Not Display Reconciled Invoices for Selected Customer,Mohamed Fathy,Mohamed Said,4,To Do,2025-03-02T17:51:00,2025-03-03T16:21:00,"### Description
__Payment Reconciliation Report Does Not Display Reconciled Invoices for Selected Customer*
__Title:*
Payment Reconciliation Report Fails to Display Reconciled Invoices and Shows Incorrect Invoice List
__Description:*
On the _Payment Reconciliation Report_ screen, when a user selects a customer, the report _does not display_ the invoices that have been _successfully reconciled_. Instead, the _Select Invoice_ dropdown incorrectly shows _only non-reconciled invoices_, preventing users from accessing reconciliation details. This issue affects financial reporting accuracy and reconciliation tracking.
__Preconditions:*
_ The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the _Payment Reconciliation Report* module.
* At least one invoice has been successfully reconciled for the selected customer.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module ? Reports ? Payment Reconciliation Report_.
- Select a _customer_ who has reconciled invoices.
- Open the _Select Invoice_ dropdown.
- Observe that the dropdown _only lists non-reconciled invoices_ instead of displaying reconciled ones.
- Attempt to generate a reconciliation report and notice that _no data appears_ for reconciled invoices.
__Expected Result:*
_ The _Select Invoice_ dropdown should display _both fully and partially reconciled invoices* for the selected customer.
_ The report should correctly show _reconciliation details_, including _invoice status, reconciled amount, and remaining balance*.
__Actual Result:*
_ The dropdown incorrectly lists only _non-reconciled invoices*, preventing users from selecting reconciled invoices.
_ The report does not show _any data* for reconciled invoices.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Modify the query logic to _include reconciled invoices_ in the _Select Invoice* dropdown.
_ Ensure that the _report correctly fetches and displays* reconciliation details.
_ Validate that the system retrieves _both fully and partially reconciled invoices* for the selected customer.
__Severity:*
?? _High_ ? This issue impacts financial reporting and reconciliation tracking, leading to incorrect financial records.

Bug,(Sp24): Amount Field in Add Payment In Screen Accepts Negative Numbers Without Validation,mohamed Nabil,Mohamed Said,4,Code review,2025-03-02T15:15:00,2025-03-05T14:41:00,"### Description
__Title:*
Negative Amounts Can Be Entered and Saved in Payment In Screen Without Validation
__Description:*
On the _Add Payment In_ screen, the _Amount_ field in the _Detail Section_ allows users to enter negative values. The system successfully _saves and posts_ the transaction without any validation or error message. This issue leads to severe inconsistencies in _financial calculations, reconciliation, and related module transactions_, affecting overall system accuracy.
__Preconditions:*
_ The user is logged into the ERP system with permission to create and post _Payment In* transactions.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module ? Transactions ? Add Payment In_ screen.
- In the _Detail Section_, enter a _negative amount_ (e.g., {{-1000}}).
- Click _Save_, then _Post_ the transaction.
- Observe that the system allows the transaction to be saved and posted without validation.
- Check the related financial reports, reconciliation, and transaction history to see discrepancies.
__Expected Result:*
_ The system should _not allow_ negative values in the _Amount* field.
_ If a negative value is entered, an _error message* should be displayed, preventing the user from saving or posting the transaction.
* Proper validation should be enforced to ensure only positive values are accepted.
__Actual Result:*
_ The system allows negative amounts in the _Amount* field.
* The transaction is successfully saved and posted without any validation.
_ This leads to financial calculation errors in _balancing, reconciliation, and other dependent modules*.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Implement _validation_ to restrict negative values in the _Amount* field.
_ Display a clear _error message* when a negative value is entered.
* Prevent transactions with negative amounts from being saved or posted.
_ Conduct a _system-wide audit* to check if similar validation issues exist in other financial modules.
__Severity:*
?? _Critical_ ? This issue impacts financial accuracy, reconciliation, and balance calculations, leading to serious financial discrepancies.

Bug,(SP24) @General: Search Functionality Not Working in Advanced Search (Select Account Dialog) Across All ERP System Modules (Add/Edit Screens),mohamed Nabil,Mohamed Said,3,Code review,2025-03-02T13:34:00,2025-03-05T16:00:00,"### Description
__Title:*
Search Functionality Fails in the Advanced Search Dialog for Selecting an Account Across Multiple ERP Modules
__Description:*
In multiple modules of the ERP system, including _Treasury Definition, Bank Definition, Payment In, and Payment Out_, the _Advanced Search (Select Account)_ dialog does not filter results when the user enters a search term. This issue prevents users from efficiently finding and selecting an account, leading to delays and poor user experience.
__Affected Modules:*
* Treasury Definition Add/Edit
* Bank Definition Add/Edit
* Payment In Add/Edit
* Payment Out Add/Edit
__Preconditions:*
* The user is logged into the ERP system with appropriate access to the affected modules.
* The system contains existing accounts available for selection.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to any of the affected modules (e.g., _Treasury Definition Add/Edit_).
- Click on the _Select Account_ field to open the _Advanced Search Dialog_.
- In the search input field, type an account name or account code.
- Observe that no filtering or search results appear based on the entered query.
__Expected Result:*
* As the user types in the search field, the system should dynamically filter and display relevant account results.
_ The search should support filtering based on _account name_ or _account code*.
_ If no results match the search term, an appropriate _""No results found""* message should be displayed.
__Actual Result:*
* The search input does not trigger any filtering of the account list.
* The full list of accounts remains unchanged, even when entering a search term.
* Users are unable to efficiently locate specific accounts, leading to a poor user experience.
__Suggested Fix:*
* Ensure that the search input field triggers a request to filter the accounts dynamically.
_ Validate whether _API requests* for search functionality are being made correctly.
_ Implement _debouncing* to prevent excessive search requests.
_ Ensure that the search function considers both _account name_ and _account code*.
* Display an appropriate message when no matching results are found.
__Severity:*
_High_ ? The inability to search for accounts across multiple modules significantly impacts user workflow and system efficiency.

Bug,(SP24): Missing column filtration functionality in the Fund Transfer List View.,Ahmed Gamal,Mohamed Said,2,Code review,2025-02-27T18:46:00,2025-03-03T13:53:00,"### Description
__Title:*
Missing column filtration functionality in the Fund Transfer List View.
----
__Description:*
In the _Fund Transfer List View_, the column filtration feature is missing. Users are unable to filter the data displayed in the table by specific columns (e.g., Code, Date, Transferred Amount, From Payment Hub, To Payment Hub, etc.). This functionality is essential for users to quickly locate and analyze specific Fund Transfer records based on their criteria.
----
__Precondition:*
- The user is logged in with the necessary permissions.
- The _Fund Transfer List View_ is accessible.
- Multiple Fund Transfer records exist in the system.
----
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module > Transaction Submenu > Fund Transfer_.
- Observe the table displaying Fund Transfer records.
- Observe the Top Screen above the Table.
----
__Expected Result:*
* The system should provide column filtration functionality, allowing users to filter the data by specific columns (e.g., Code, Date, Transferred Amount, From Payment Hub, To Payment Hub, etc.).
* Users should be able to apply filters (e.g., text search, date range, dropdown selection) to narrow down the displayed records.
* The filtered data should update dynamically based on the applied filters.
----
__Actual Result:*
* The column filtration functionality is missing in the Fund Transfer List View.
* Users cannot filter the data by specific columns, making it difficult to locate and analyze specific records.

Bug,(SP24): Non-descriptive error message displayed in a pop-up when selecting a Bank account with an invalid payment method.,Hager Mostafa,Mohamed Said,2,Code review,2025-02-27T17:59:00,2025-03-02T16:12:00,"### Description
__Title:*
Non-descriptive error message displayed in a pop-up when selecting a Bank account with an invalid payment method.
----
__Description:*
When a user selects a _Bank account_ that has a payment method other than _Transfer_ (e.g., Visa or Span) in the _Fund Transfer Add_ screen, a non-descriptive error message is displayed in a pop-up at the bottom layer. The message reads:
_""Error you can't select bank without payment method.""_
This message is not informative, does not guide the user to resolve the issue, and appears in an incorrect view (pop-up at the bottom layer). According to the business rules, only Bank accounts with the _Transfer_ payment method should be selectable for Fund Transfers.
----
__Precondition:*
- The user is logged in with the necessary permissions.
- The _Fund Transfer Add_ screen is accessible.
- At least one Bank account exists in the system with a payment method other than _Transfer_ (e.g., Visa or Span).
----
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module > Transaction Submenu > Fund Transfer_.
- Click on the _Add_ button to open the Fund Transfer Add screen.
- In the _Send From_ section:
-_ Select _Bank_ in the _Payment Hub* field.
-_ In the _Payment Hub Details_ field, select a Bank account that has a payment method other than _Transfer* (e.g., Visa or Span).
- Observe the system behavior.
----
__Expected Result:*
_ The system should display a _clear and informative error message_ in the correct view (e.g., near the _Payment Hub Details* field or in a modal dialog).
_ The error message should guide the user to select a Bank account with the _Transfer* payment method.
* Example of an informative message:
_""Invalid Payment Method: Please select a Bank account with the 'Transfer' payment method.""_
----
__Actual Result:*
* A non-descriptive error message is displayed in a pop-up at the bottom layer:
_""Error you can't select bank without payment method.""_
* The message does not specify the issue or guide the user to resolve it.
* The pop-up appears in an incorrect view (bottom layer), making it less noticeable.
----
__Impact:*
* Users are confused by the non-descriptive error message and may not understand how to resolve the issue.
* The incorrect placement of the pop-up (bottom layer) makes it easy to miss, leading to frustration and delays in completing the transaction.
* This issue affects the user experience and may result in incorrect data entry or abandoned transactions.
----
__Severity:*
_Medium_ ? This is a usability issue that impacts the user experience but does not prevent the core functionality from working.
----
__Priority:*
_High_ ? The error message needs to be improved to ensure users can complete their tasks efficiently.
----
__Attachments:*
- Screenshot of the non-descriptive error message in the pop-up.
- Screenshot of the Fund Transfer Add screen with the selected Bank account.
- Logs or additional error details from the system.
----
__Root Cause Analysis (If Available):*
The issue occurs because:
- The system allows the selection of Bank accounts with payment methods other than _Transfer_, even though the business rules specify that only _Transfer_ is acceptable.
- The error message is hardcoded and does not provide sufficient context or guidance.
- The pop-up is displayed in an incorrect view (bottom layer), making it less noticeable and user-friendly.
----
__Suggested Fix:*
- _Validation Rule:_
-_ Update the system to filter and display only Bank accounts with the _Transfer_ payment method in the _Payment Hub Details* dropdown.
-* If a Bank account with an invalid payment method is selected, prevent the selection and display an informative error message in the correct view.
- _Error Message:_
-* Replace the non-descriptive message with a clear and informative one, such as:
-_""Invalid Payment Method: Please select a Bank account with the 'Transfer' payment method.""_
- _UI/UX Improvement:_
-_ Display the error message near the _Payment Hub Details* field or in a modal dialog for better visibility.
-* Ensure the message is displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g., red text with an icon).

----
__Root Cause Analysis (If Available):*
The error message suggests that the issue occurs while saving the entity changes. The inner exception (not visible in the logs) may provide more details about the specific cause. Possible causes include:
* A mismatch between the payment methods (Transfer and Cash) during the transaction processing.
* A database constraint or validation rule that is not being handled correctly.
* An issue with the entity mapping or data persistence logic.
----
__Suggested Fix:*
- Investigate the inner exception details to identify the exact cause of the error.
- Ensure that the system handles the combination of _Transfer_ (Bank) and _Cash_ (Treasury) payment methods correctly.
- Validate the entity mapping and database constraints to ensure they align with the business rules.
- Add proper error handling and user-friendly messages to guide users in case of similar issues.
----
__Additional Notes:*
* This issue should be tested in the development environment before deploying to production.
* Regression testing should be performed to ensure that other Fund Transfer scenarios (e.g., Bank to Bank, Treasury to Treasury) are not affected.

Bug,(SP24): Save Button Successfully Saves Reconciliation but Does Not Redirect or Reset the Screen,Ahmed Gamal,Mohamed Said,3,Code review,2025-02-27T16:24:00,2025-03-03T13:53:00,"### Description
__Title:*
Save Button Successfully Saves Reconciliation but Does Not Redirect or Reset the Screen
__Description:*
On the _Payment Reconciliation_ screen in the _Finance App_, after clicking the _Save_ button, the reconciliation is successfully saved, and a _success popup_ is displayed. However, the screen remains stuck, and all manipulated fields still retain the same data and state instead of refreshing or redirecting. This creates confusion for users as they are unsure whether the reconciliation has been processed correctly.
__Preconditions:*
_ The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the _Finance App*.
_ The user has navigated to _Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Reconciliation*.
* A customer and a payment have been selected.
* One or more invoices have been selected for reconciliation.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Reconciliation_.
- Select a customer from the _Customer Selection_ popup.
- Select a payment from the _Payment Selection_ popup.
- Choose one or more invoices for reconciliation.
- Click the _Reconcile_ button to apply the payment.
- Click the _Save_ button.
- Observe that the reconciliation is successfully saved, and a _success popup_ appears.
- Notice that the screen does not refresh or redirect, and the fields still show the same data.
__Expected Result:*
* After successful reconciliation, the screen should either:
__ Redirect the user to the _Payment Reconciliation List_ screen.
__ Refresh and reset the fields to their default state.
* The previously reconciled invoices should no longer appear as pending reconciliation.
_ The UI should provide a _clear indication* that the process has been completed.
__Actual Result:*
_ The _Save* button successfully saves the reconciliation and displays a success popup.
* The screen remains unchanged with all manipulated fields retaining the same data.
* Users are unsure whether the reconciliation was actually processed.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Implement a _screen refresh or redirection* after successful reconciliation.
_ Automatically _reset all fields* and update the invoice list to reflect the reconciliation.
_ Ensure that reconciled invoices are _removed from the pending list*.
* Provide a clear confirmation message indicating that the process is complete and that no further action is required.
__Severity:*
_Medium-High_ ? The issue does not prevent reconciliation but causes confusion and inefficiency for users.

_ The user has navigated to _Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Reconciliation*.
* A customer and a payment have been selected.
* One or more invoices have been selected for reconciliation.

- Select a customer from the _Customer Selection_ popup.
- Select a payment from the _Payment Selection_ popup.
- Choose one or more invoices for reconciliation.
- Click the _Reconcile_ button to apply the payment.
- Click the _Cancel_ button to discard the reconciliation action.
__Expected Result:*
_ The _Cancel* button should successfully revert any unsaved reconciliation actions.

__Actual Result:*
_ The _Cancel* button is not actionable (clicking it does not trigger any response).
* Unsaved reconciliation changes remain on the screen.
_ Users are forced to _reload the page manually* to undo changes.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Ensure the _Cancel* button is correctly bound to a function that reverts changes.
_ Implement a _confirmation popup* to confirm the cancellation of actions.
* Ensure that unsaved changes are discarded, and the original state is restored.
_ Validate error logs to check if there are _JavaScript errors or missing event listeners*.

Bug,(SP21) @General: Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing ,Abanoub.Nabil,Mohamed Said,3,To Do,2025-02-23T13:29:00,2025-02-23T14:21:00,"### Description
_Title:_
Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing
----
_Description:_
The search functionality does not efficiently handle user input, causing an excessive number of requests to be sent to the server. Each time the user types a character, a request is immediately triggered, even if the time between keystrokes is less than one second. This can lead to server overload, performance issues, and unnecessary network traffic. Implementing _debouncing_ should optimize the search behavior.
----
_Precondition:_
* The ERP system is accessible, and the user has access to the search feature.
----
_Steps to Reproduce:_
- Log in to the ERP system.
- Navigate to a screen where the search functionality is available.
- Start typing a search term letter by letter.
- Observe that each keystroke triggers a request without waiting for a pause in typing.
----
_Expected Result:_
_ The search functionality should implement _debouncing*, meaning it waits for a short delay (e.g., 500?800ms) after the user stops typing before sending a request.
* This reduces unnecessary server requests and improves performance.
----
_Actual Result:_
* A request is sent for every character typed, even if the delay between keystrokes is very short.
* This causes excessive API calls, leading to increased server load and potential performance degradation.
----
_Suggested Fix:_
_ Implement _Debouncing* in the search functionality to delay API requests until the user has stopped typing for a defined period (e.g., 500?800ms).

- Proceed with the payment process.
- Complete the transaction and observe the confirmation process.
----
_Expected Result:_
* After completing the payment, a confirmation message should be displayed.
* The invoice status should update to ""Paid.""
* The payment record should be properly stored in the system.
----
_Actual Result:_
* The payment confirmation does not appear after completing the transaction.
* The invoice status remains unchanged (e.g., still marked as ""Pending"").
* The user is unsure if the payment was successful, leading to potential duplicate transactions.

Bug,(Sp21): Unable to Save Return Purchase Invoice Due to Unposted Transaction,Abanoub.Nabil,Mohamed Said,3,To Do,2025-02-17T17:52:00,2025-03-03T17:03:00,"### Description
__Title: Unable to Save Return Purchase Invoice Due to Unposted Transaction*
__Issue Description:*
When the user attempts to _return items_ using the _""Return Purchase Invoice"" Add_ screen and saves the transaction without posting it, they are unable to create another return transaction for the same invoice.
On the second attempt to return items from the same invoice, clicking the _Save_ button _does nothing_, and the _network log_ shows an error with _Status Code 500_.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Return Purchase Invoice Add_ screen.
- Select a _Purchase Invoice_ to return items from.
- Fill in all _required data_ and return _each item's available quantity_.
- Click _Save_ (but do not post the transaction).
- Open the _Return Purchase Invoice Add_ screen again and select the _same invoice_.
- Fill in all _required data_ and attempt to _return the items again_.
- Click _Save_ and observe that _nothing happens_.
- Check the _network log_, which shows _HTTP 500 Internal Server Error_.
__Expected Behavior:*
_ The system should _display an informative message_ if there is an _unposted* return transaction related to the same Purchase Invoice.
_ The message should guide the user to either _post_ or _cancel* the pending return before proceeding with a new one.
_ The system should _not fail silently*, and it should prevent the user from facing an unexpected error.
__Actual Behavior:*
_ When the user attempts to save a second _Return Purchase Invoice* for the same invoice:
__ Clicking the _Save_ button does _nothing_.
__ The _network log_ shows an _HTTP 500 Internal Server Error_.
__ No error message is displayed to the user, leaving them confused.
h4. 
__Impact:*
_ Prevents users from _processing valid returns*.
_ Causes _confusion* due to the lack of an error message.
_ Results in _system instability* (HTTP 500 errors).
_ Affects the _accuracy of purchase return records*.
__Severity:_ _High*
This issue blocks users from completing return transactions, affecting inventory accuracy and financial records.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Implement _validation logic_ to check if an _unposted return transaction_ exists for the selected _Purchase Invoice*.
_ Display a _clear error message* before saving, such as:
_""There is an unposted return transaction related to this Purchase Invoice. Please post or cancel it before creating a new one.""_
_ Ensure that the system _does not trigger a 500 error* and handles this scenario gracefully.

Bug,"(SP21): Incorrect ""Amount Exceeds the Price in RowRow3"" Error in Purchase Invoice Add Screen",Abanoub.Nabil,Mohamed Said,3,To Do,2025-02-17T16:03:00,2025-03-03T17:00:00,"### Description
__Title: Incorrect ""Amount Exceeds the Price in RowRow3"" Error in Purchase Invoice Add Screen*
__Issue Description:*
When the user adds a _Purchase Invoice_ and inputs a discount amount that is _less than the item cost_, the system incorrectly displays the error message:
{quote}_""Discount exceeds the price in rowRow 3 -- Amount cannot exceed subtota_l_""_{quote}
This prevents the user from proceeding, despite the discount being valid.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to the _Purchase Invoice Add_ screen.
- Select a _Warehouse_ and add items.
- Input a _discount amount_ that is less than the item's cost.
- Input _Cost_ and _discount amount_ as Decimal Numbers.
- Observe that the system _incorrectly displays_ the error:
-_ _""Amount Exceeds the Price in RowRow3""*
- Try to proceed with saving the invoice, but the system prevents it.
__Expected Behavior:*
_ The system should only display the _""Amount Exceeds the Price""_ error if the discount entered _exceeds* the item cost.
_ If the discount is valid (i.e., _less than or equal to the item cost*), the system should allow the user to proceed without displaying an error.
__Actual Behavior:*
_ The error appears _incorrectly* even when the discount amount is valid.
_ The user is unable to save the _Purchase Invoice* because of the incorrect validation.
__Severity:_ _High*
This issue blocks valid transactions and impacts business operations.

Bug,(SP21): Help Button Navigation Issues,Abanoub.Nabil,Mohamed Said,3,To Do,2025-02-17T15:24:00,2025-02-17T16:50:00,"### Description
__Bug Report: Help Button Navigation Issues*
__Issue Description:*
When the user clicks the _Help_ button on any screen, the system navigates to the Help Pages. However, the following issues occur:
- _No Return to Previous Screen:_ There is no option to return back to the previous screen from the Help Pages.
- _Incorrect Back Navigation Behavior:_ If the user manually navigates back, it returns to the parent-related Help Pages instead of the previous screen.
- _Side Menu Displays Incorrect Options:_ The side menu incorrectly displays _General Settings_ module options instead of maintaining the context of the previously accessed screen.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to any module or transaction screen (e.g., Sales Invoice, Purchase Order, etc.).
- Click on the _Help_ button.
- Observe that the system navigates to the _Help Pages_ instead of opening in a new tab.
- Attempt to navigate back using the browser back button.
- Notice that it does not return to the previous screen but instead loads parent-related help pages.
- Observe the side menu displaying _General Settings_ instead of the relevant module options.
__Expected Behavior:*
_ The Help Page should open in a _new window_ or _new tab* instead of redirecting the user from the current screen.
_ If the Help Page is opened in the same window, a _clear return option* should be provided to navigate back to the previously accessed screen.
* The side menu should remain consistent with the user's previously selected module / App, not default to General Settings.
__Actual Behavior:*
* The system redirects the user away from their current work screen when they click the Help button.
* There is no direct way to return to the screen where the user clicked the Help button.
_ The side menu shows _General Settings* options instead of the appropriate module.
__Impact:*
* Interrupts user workflow as they lose their place in the system.
* Causes confusion due to incorrect navigation and missing return functionality.
* Leads to inefficiency since users have to manually navigate back to the intended module.
__Severity:_ _Medium to High*
This issue affects usability and navigation across all modules, causing disruptions in user experience.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Modify the Help Button functionality to _open the Help Pages in a new tab or window* instead of navigating away.
_ Ensure that if the Help Page opens in the same window, there is a _Return to Previous Page* button.
* Maintain the side menu context based on the user's current module instead of defaulting to General Settings.

_Title:_
Missing Walkthrough Guide for the ""Fund Transfer"" Module in Finance App
_Description:_
The _""Fund Transfer""_ module under _Finance App ? Transactions_ does not have a _Walkthrough Guide_ to assist users in understanding its functionality.

- Look for a _Walkthrough Guide_ or an onboarding tutorial.
- Observe that no _Walkthrough Guide_ is available.
- Compare with other Finance App modules where walkthroughs are present.
----
__Expected Result:*
_ A _Walkthrough Guide_ should be available to explain the steps involved in _Fund Transfers*.
_ Users should receive _step-by-step instructions* on filling out required fields and completing a transfer.
_ A _helpful tooltip or onboarding overlay* should guide users through key functionalities.
----
__Actual Result:*
_ No _Walkthrough Guide_ exists for the _Fund Transfer* module.
* Users are left to figure out the process manually.
_ This inconsistency with other Finance App modules affects _usability_ and _user onboarding*.
----
__Severity:*
_Low_ ? The module functions correctly, but usability is impacted for new users.
__Priority:*
_Medium_ ? Important for consistency and improving user experience.

_Title:_
Unexpected Stock Increase When Posting a Purchase Invoice Multiple Times
_Description:_
In the _Purchase Invoice_ screen of the Purchase App, an unexpected behavior occurs when posting an invoice. Each time the user clicks the _Post_ button, the item's stock quantity increases. This issue is visible in the _Item Card Report_ and the _Stock Out Add Screen_ under the _Item Availability_ field. However, the _Purchase Invoice List View_ correctly shows only one posted purchase invoice, and the _Stock In_ screen reflects only one _Posted Stock In_ entry from the purchase.
----
__Precondition:*
* User is logged into the Purchase App.
_ The user has access to the _Purchase Invoice* module.
_ At least one _item* exists in the inventory.
----
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to the _Purchase Invoice_ screen.
- Fill in all required fields, including _Supplier, Date, and Item Details_.
- Add an _item_ with a valid quantity.
- Click _Save_ to create the purchase invoice.
- Click _Post_ button _Multiple_ time to finalize the purchase invoice.
- Observe the _Item Card Report_ and _Stock Out Add Screen (Item Availability field)_ ? stock increases.
- Observe that the stock quantity increases again, even though only one purchase invoice is recorded in the _List View_ and _Stock In Screen_.
----
__Expected Result:*
_ The system should prevent multiple postings of the same _Purchase Invoice*.
_ Clicking _Post* multiple times should not result in duplicate stock increases.
_ Stock quantity updates should match the actual _Posted Purchase Invoice* count.
* If the invoice is already posted, the system should display an error message like:
_""This Purchase Invoice has already been posted. No further stock updates are required.""_
----
__Actual Result:*
_ Clicking the _Post* button multiple times increases the stock quantity incorrectly.
_ The _Item Card Report_ and _Stock Out Add Screen* reflect inflated stock values.
_ The _Purchase Invoice List View_ and _Stock In Screen* correctly show only one posted invoice.
----
__Severity:*
_Critical_ ? Leads to incorrect stock levels, impacting inventory management and financial reporting.
__Priority:*
_High_ ? Needs immediate resolution to prevent stock discrepancies.

_Description:_
In the _Return Purchase Invoice_ list view screen of the Purchase App, the system does not provide column filtering functionality.

- Try to apply a filter for any column (e.g., filter by a specific _Vendor Name_ or _Invoice Number_).
- Notice that no filtering option is available.
----
__Expected Result:*
_ The list view should provide a _column filtering* functionality, allowing users to filter invoices based on attributes such as:
__ _Invoice Number_
__ _Vensor Name_
__ _Return Date_
__ _Status_ (e.g., Pending, Posted, Canceled)
* Users should be able to enter search values or select from dropdowns where applicable.

_Description:_
In the _Return Purchase Invoice_ list view of the Purchase App, the _Print_ button is non-functional. When a user selects a _Return Purchase Invoice_ and clicks the _Print_ button, no action is triggered, preventing users from printing invoices directly from the list view. This impacts the usability of the system, as users must find alternative ways to obtain a printed version of the invoice.

_Title:_
System Allows Posting 'Return Purchase Invoice' with a Date Before the 'Purchase Invoice' Date
_Description:_
In the Purchase App, the system allows users to post a _Return Purchase Invoice_ with a date that is earlier than the original _Purchase Invoice_ date. This leads to logical inconsistencies in financial records, as an invoice return should not precede the purchase itself.
_Precondition:_
* User is logged into the Purchase App.
* User has access to the 'Return Purchase Invoice' functionality.
_ A valid _Purchase Invoice* exists in the system.
_Steps to Reproduce:_
- Navigate to the _Return Purchase Invoice_ Add Screen.
- Select an existing _Purchase Invoice_ from the list.
- Enter a _Return Purchase Invoice Date_ that is earlier than the selected _Purchase Invoice Date_.
- Click on the _Post_ button to submit the return invoice.
_Expected Result:_
_ The system should validate the _Return Purchase Invoice Date_ and prevent posting if it is earlier than the corresponding _Purchase Invoice Date*.
* An appropriate error message should be displayed, such as:
_""Return Purchase Invoice date cannot be earlier than the original Purchase Invoice date.""_
_Actual Result:_
_ The system accepts and posts the _Return Purchase Invoice_ even if its date is before the _Purchase Invoice Date*.

- Notice the _Delete_ action button is present for each item row.
- Click on the _Delete_ button for any item in the list.
- The item is removed from the table, and the user is unable to reselect or manipulate the item again.
_Expected Result:_

Bug,(SP21): System Accepts Discount Amount Greater Than Cost in Purchase Invoice but Displays Incorrect Validation After Save and Post,mohamed Nabil,Mohamed Said,3,Testing,2025-01-30T14:11:00,2025-03-03T16:50:00,"### Description
_Title:_
System Accepts Discount Amount Greater Than Cost in Purchase Invoice but Displays Incorrect Validation After Save and Post
_Description:_
When a user inputs a discount amount greater than the cost in the Purchase Invoice, the system allows this value to be entered. However, upon clicking the ""Save"" button, a descriptive validation message appears, prompting the user to correct the discount amount. Once the user clears the greater discount and enters a valid value, the transaction is saved successfully. But when the user clicks the ""Post"" button, an undescriptive validation message is displayed with network error messages such as ""Cost must be positive"" and ""Quantity must be positive."" This behavior indicates that the system either does not correctly clear cache or does not respond properly to changes in field values.
_Precondition:_
* User is logged into the ERP system.
* The user is on the Purchase Invoice screen.
* The discount amount is entered as greater than the cost.
_Steps to Reproduce:_
- Navigate to the Purchase app > Purchase Invoice.
- Enter all required fields for the purchase invoice.
- Click Add new Line to add new item
- Select Items from the Dropdown and input valid Quantity and Cost
- Input a discount amount that is greater than the item cost.
- Click the ""Save"" button.
- A descriptive validation message is shown indicating the discount amount is greater than the cost.
- Correct the discount amount to a valid value and click the ""Save"" button again. The transaction is saved successfully.
- Click the ""Post"" button to try to post the transaction.
_Expected Result:_
* The discount amount should not be allowed to exceed the cost value in the first place.
* After inputting valid values and saving the transaction, the post operation should succeed without any validation errors.
_Actual Result:_
* The system allows the discount amount to exceed the cost.
* After saving, the user receives a validation message that prompts them to adjust the discount amount.
* After entering a valid discount and saving the transaction, the user encounters an undescriptive validation message when trying to post the transaction.
* The network error messages include ""Cost must be positive"" and ""Quantity must be positive,"" even though the data appears to be correct.
* The system does not correctly clear cache or respond properly to field value changes, causing the undescriptive error.

_Description_:
In the Financial Calendar screen, when entering the date range _1/1/2026 to 2/1/2026_ and attempting to close the year, no error message appears despite unposted journal entries within the specified date range.

- Enter the date range _1/1/2026 to 2/1/2026_.
- Create a journal entry with a date within this range (_e.g., 2/1/2026_) and save it without posting.
- Attempt to close the financial year using the _Close Year_ option.
_Expected Result_:
An error message should appear, stating that all journal entries within the selected date range must be posted before closing the financial year.
_Actual Result_:
* The system allows the year to be closed without verifying the status of journal entries.
* No error message appears to notify the user of the unposted journal entry.

_Expected Result:_
The system should prevent deletion of tax groups that are assigned to tax definitions, displaying a validation error message such as:
* ""This tax group cannot be deleted as it is assigned to active tax definitions.""
----
_Actual Result:_
The system allows deletion of tax groups that are assigned to tax definitions without any validation, resulting in:
* Broken references in the associated tax definitions.

_Title:_
App Checkboxes Not Clearly Visible in Invoice Creation Process
_Description:_
When the admin creates an invoice, the checkboxes for selecting apps are not clearly visible. This may result in the admin unintentionally missing some app selections, causing those apps to be excluded from the invoice. Consequently, the Preview Invoice and the confirmation email (""Complete your Registration"") do not reflect the correct app costs, leading to incorrect invoice totals and missing cost breakdowns.
----
__Precondition:*
* The admin user has access to the admin portal.
* Apps are available for selection with prices greater than 0.
----
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Log in to the admin portal as an admin user.

- Attempt to select all available apps from the list (observe the visibility of checkboxes).
- Generate the invoice and preview it.
- Submit the invoice and verify the confirmation email (""Complete your Registration"").
----
__Expected Result:*
- The checkboxes for app selection should be clearly visible and actionable.
- The Preview Invoice should accurately display the selected apps and their associated costs.
- The confirmation email should include a detailed cost breakdown and the correct total.
----
__Actual Result:*
- Checkboxes for app selection are faint or blend into the background, making them difficult to identify.
- Some apps may not be selected due to checkbox visibility issues, resulting in missing costs in the Preview Invoice.
- The confirmation email omits app costs and shows an incorrect total.

__Title: Incorrect Calculation of Debit and Credit Sums in Bank Account Statement*
_Project/Module:_ ERP System - Bank Account Statement
_Severity:_ Critical
----
_Issue Description:_
The Bank Account Statement screen incorrectly calculates the total sums for Debit and Credit transactions. Instead of summing only the transactions within the selected period or filter criteria, the system sums all Debit and Credit values for all saved transactions, regardless of the applied filters (e.g., Payment In and Payment Out).
----
_Steps to Reproduce:_
- Navigate to the _Bank Account Statement_ screen.
- Apply filters to specify a date range or limit transactions to Payment In or Payment Out.
- Review the displayed Debit and Credit sums at the bottom of the statement.
- Compare the sum to individual transactions visible on the screen.
----
_Expected Behavior:_
* The total sum of Debit under the debit column should have the correct value of the total sum of all the Debits in the Debit Column.
*  The total sum of Credit under the Credit column should have the correct value of the total sum of all the Credits in the Credit Column.

__Title*: Descriptive Columns (e.g., Code, Name) Can Be Unchecked in Show/Hide Column Feature
_Module_: Payment In / Payment out/ Any Grid with Show/Hide Column Feature
_Severity_: High
_Priority_: Critical
_Status_: Open
----
__Description*:
The current implementation of the Show/Hide column functionality allows users to uncheck critical descriptive columns, such as ""Code"" and ""Name."" This results in the inability to identify records, leading to operational inefficiencies and potential errors when performing actions like editing or deleting records.
----
__Steps to Reproduce*:
- Navigate to a grid (e.g., Business Owner List or Invoice List) with the Show/Hide column option.
- Click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" button.
- Uncheck essential descriptive columns like ""Code"" or ""Name.""
- Observe that the grid no longer displays identifying information for each row, but the ""Action"" column (View/Edit/Delete) remains active.
----
__Expected Result*:
_ _Critical descriptive columns (e.g., ""Code,"" ""Name"") should be fixed and unchangeable.*
_ _Users should not be able to uncheck these columns.*
_ _If the user attempts to uncheck them, a validation message should appear:*
_""Essential descriptive columns cannot be hidden to preserve record identification.""_
----
__Actual Result*:
* Descriptive columns are unchecked without restriction.
* The grid displays rows with only the ""Action"" column, making it impossible to distinguish records.

----
_ _Steps to Reproduce*:

__ The description text in the confirmation dialog should have sufficient padding from the action buttons (Cancel and Save), ensuring proper readability and visual separation.
----
_ _Actual Results*:
__ The description text is very close to the action buttons, making the dialog look cluttered and reducing readability.

_ _Title*: Font Size, Vertical Spacing, and Language Directionality Issues
----
_ _Description*:
The current user interface exhibits several design and usability issues:
_- _Font Size*:
_-_ The font size of field hints and button labels is too small, making it difficult for users to read comfortably.
_- _Vertical Spacing*:
_-_ There is insufficient vertical spacing between the header and sub-header, resulting in a crowded appearance.
_- _Language Directionality*:
_-_ When the language is switched to Arabic, the font directionality remains _LTR (left-to-right)_ instead of _RTL (right-to-left)_, which is inconsistent with Arabic text conventions.
----
_ _Preconditions*:
__ The user accesses a screen with fields, buttons, headers, and sub-headers.
__ The user changes the system language to Arabic.
----
_ _Steps to Reproduce*:
*- Open any screen with input fields, buttons, headers, and sub-headers.
*- Observe the font size of field hints and button labels.
*- Observe the spacing between the header and sub-header.
_- Switch the language to _Arabic* in the system settings.
*- Observe the font directionality after the language change.
----
_ _Expected Results*:
_- _Font Size*:
_-_ Field hints and button labels should have a font size that ensures readability and accessibility.
_- _Vertical Spacing*:
_-_ There should be adequate vertical spacing between the header and sub-header to enhance visual clarity and alignment.
_- _Language Directionality*:
_-_ When switching to Arabic, the text directionality should automatically change to _RTL_ to align with Arabic language norms.
----
_ _Actual Results*:
_- _Font Size*:
_-_ Field hints and button labels are rendered with a small font size, making them hard to read.
_- _Vertical Spacing*:
_-_ Insufficient spacing between the header and sub-header creates a visually cramped layout.
_- _Language Directionality*:
_-_ Text remains _LTR_ when the language is switched to Arabic, causing inconsistency and usability issues for Arabic-speaking users.

Bug,(SP20):Design Issues in the New Login Screen of Microtec ERP,Maha.muhammed,Mohamed Said,2,To Do,2024-12-19T12:33:00,2024-12-19T13:03:00,"### Description
_ _Title*: Design Faults in the New Login Screen of Microtec ERP
----
_ _Description*:
The newly implemented login screen of the Microtec ERP has several design flaws that impact the professionalism and user perception of the system. The percentage value displayed for ""Sales Growth"" is unreasonably low at _45%_, which can negatively affect user morale. Additionally, the image depicting an employee using the system features a _young boy in casual attire_, which does not align with the formal and professional tone expected for an ERP system catering to business environments.
----
_ _Issues Identified*:
_- _Percentage Display*:
_-_ The ""Sales Growth"" percentage is set at _45%_, which gives the impression of poor performance. This value should either reflect realistic, customizable data or be removed if irrelevant.
_- _Image of Employee*:
_-_ The login screen features a _young boy in casual clothing_, which is unprofessional for a corporate ERP system. The image should be replaced with a representation of a professional employee in formal attire to align with the target audience and business context.
----
_ _Preconditions*:
*- The user is presented with the login screen of the Microtec ERP.
*- The design elements (percentage growth, background image) are visible on the screen.
----
_ _Steps to Reproduce*:
_- Navigate to the _Microtec ERP Login Screen*.
*- Observe the ""Sales Growth"" percentage displayed.
*- Observe the image of the employee featured on the login screen.
----
_ _Expected Result*:
__ The login screen should maintain a _professional and motivating appearance_ with:
__* An appropriate sales growth percentage or no percentage if not required.
__* A formal image of an employee in professional attire.
----
_ _Actual Result*:
__ The ""Sales Growth"" percentage is set at a low and discouraging value of _45%_.
__ The featured employee image is unprofessional, showing a young boy in casual clothing.
