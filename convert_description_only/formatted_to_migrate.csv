__Description:*
On the _Payment Reconciliation Report_ screen, when the user clicks the _Print_ button without applying any filters or selecting a customer, the system _generates an empty print preview_ instead of displaying a proper validation message.

Bug,(SP21) @General: Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing,Abanoub Nabil,Muhammed Saeed,2,New,2025-02-23T11:29:00.000Z,2025-02-23T12:21:00.000Z,"_Title:_
Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing
----
_Description:_
The search functionality does not efficiently handle user input, causing an excessive number of requests to be sent to the server. Each time the user types a character, a request is immediately triggered, even if the time between keystrokes is less than one second. This can lead to server overload, performance issues, and unnecessary network traffic. Implementing _debouncing_ should optimize the search behavior.
----
_Precondition:_
* The ERP system is accessible, and the user has access to the search feature.
----
_Steps to Reproduce:_
- Log in to the ERP system.
- Navigate to a screen where the search functionality is available.
- Start typing a search term letter by letter.
- Observe that each keystroke triggers a request without waiting for a pause in typing.
----
_Expected Result:_
_ The search functionality should implement _debouncing*, meaning it waits for a short delay (e.g., 500?800ms) after the user stops typing before sending a request.
* This reduces unnecessary server requests and improves performance.
----
_Actual Result:_
* A request is sent for every character typed, even if the delay between keystrokes is very short.
* This causes excessive API calls, leading to increased server load and potential performance degradation.
----
_Suggested Fix:_
_ Implement _Debouncing* in the search functionality to delay API requests until the user has stopped typing for a defined period (e.g., 500?800ms)."

System Accepts Discount Amount Greater Than Cost in Purchase Invoice but Displays Incorrect Validation After Save and Post
_Description:_
When a user inputs a discount amount greater than the cost in the Purchase Invoice, the system allows this value to be entered. However, upon clicking the Save button, a descriptive validation message appears, prompting the user to correct the discount amount. Once the user clears the greater discount and enters a valid value, the transaction is saved successfully. But when the user clicks the Post button, an undescriptive validation message is displayed with network error messages such as Cost must be positive and Quantity must be positive. This behavior indicates that the system either does not correctly clear cache or does not respond properly to changes in field values.
_Precondition:_
* User is logged into the ERP system.
* The user is on the Purchase Invoice screen.
* The discount amount is entered as greater than the cost.
_Steps to Reproduce:_
- Navigate to the Purchase app > Purchase Invoice.

- Click Add new Line to add new item
- Select Items from the Dropdown and input valid Quantity and Cost
- Input a discount amount that is greater than the item cost.
- Click the Save button.
- A descriptive validation message is shown indicating the discount amount is greater than the cost.
- Correct the discount amount to a valid value and click the Save button again. The transaction is saved successfully.
- Click the Post button to try to post the transaction.
_Expected Result:_
* The discount amount should not be allowed to exceed the cost value in the first place.
* After inputting valid values and saving the transaction, the post operation should succeed without any validation errors.
_Actual Result:_
* The system allows the discount amount to exceed the cost.
* After saving, the user receives a validation message that prompts them to adjust the discount amount.
* After entering a valid discount and saving the transaction, the user encounters an undescriptive validation message when trying to post the transaction.
* The network error messages include Cost must be positive and Quantity must be positive, even though the data appears to be correct.
* The system does not correctly clear cache or respond properly to field value changes, causing the undescriptive error."

_- _Image of Employee*:
_-_ The login screen features a _young boy in casual clothing_, which is unprofessional for a corporate ERP system. The image should be replaced with a representation of a professional employee in formal attire to align with the target audience and business context.
