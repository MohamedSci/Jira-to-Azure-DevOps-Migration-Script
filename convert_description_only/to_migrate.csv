h4. *Description:*

On the *Payment Reconciliation Report* screen, when the user clicks the *Print* button without applying any filters or selecting a customer, the system *generates an empty print preview* instead of displaying a proper validation message. This can mislead users into thinking there is an issue with the report.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the *Payment Reconciliation Report* module.

* The system *generates an empty print preview* with no warning or validation message.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Implement a *validation check* before generating the print view.
* Display a *clear message* when no data is available.
* Disable the *Print button* until at least one filter is applied or relevant data is retrieved.

Bug,(SP21) @General: Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing,Abanoub Nabil,Muhammed Saeed,2,To Do,2025-02-23T11:29:00.000Z,2025-02-23T12:21:00.000Z,"*Title:*
Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing

----

*Description:*
The search functionality does not efficiently handle user input, causing an excessive number of requests to be sent to the server. Each time the user types a character, a request is immediately triggered, even if the time between keystrokes is less than one second. This can lead to server overload, performance issues, and unnecessary network traffic. Implementing *debouncing* should optimize the search behavior.

----

*Precondition:*

* The ERP system is accessible, and the user has access to the search feature.

----

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in to the ERP system.
# Navigate to a screen where the search functionality is available.
# Start typing a search term letter by letter.
# Observe that each keystroke triggers a request without waiting for a pause in typing.

----

*Expected Result:*

* The search functionality should implement *debouncing*, meaning it waits for a short delay (e.g., 500800ms) after the user stops typing before sending a request.
* This reduces unnecessary server requests and improves performance.

----

*Actual Result:*

* A request is sent for every character typed, even if the delay between keystrokes is very short.
* This causes excessive API calls, leading to increased server load and potential performance degradation.

----

*Suggested Fix:*

* Implement *Debouncing* in the search functionality to delay API requests until the user has stopped typing for a defined period (e.g., 500800ms)."

System Accepts Discount Amount Greater Than Cost in Purchase Invoice but Displays Incorrect Validation After Save and Post

*Description:*
When a user inputs a discount amount greater than the cost in the Purchase Invoice, the system allows this value to be entered. However, upon clicking the ""Save"" button, a descriptive validation message appears, prompting the user to correct the discount amount. Once the user clears the greater discount and enters a valid value, the transaction is saved successfully. But when the user clicks the ""Post"" button, an undescriptive validation message is displayed with network error messages such as ""Cost must be positive"" and ""Quantity must be positive."" This behavior indicates that the system either does not correctly clear cache or does not respond properly to changes in field values.

*Precondition:*

* User is logged into the ERP system.
* The user is on the Purchase Invoice screen.
* The discount amount is entered as greater than the cost.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the Purchase app > Purchase Invoice.
# Enter all required fields for the purchase invoice.
# Click Add new Line to add new item
# Select Items from the Dropdown and input valid Quantity and Cost
# Input a discount amount that is greater than the item cost.
# Click the ""Save"" button.
# A descriptive validation message is shown indicating the discount amount is greater than the cost.
# Correct the discount amount to a valid value and click the ""Save"" button again. The transaction is saved successfully.
# Click the ""Post"" button to try to post the transaction.

*Expected Result:*

* The discount amount should not be allowed to exceed the cost value in the first place.
* After inputting valid values and saving the transaction, the post operation should succeed without any validation errors.

*Actual Result:*

* The system allows the discount amount to exceed the cost.
* After saving, the user receives a validation message that prompts them to adjust the discount amount.
* After entering a valid discount and saving the transaction, the user encounters an undescriptive validation message when trying to post the transaction.
* The network error messages include ""Cost must be positive"" and ""Quantity must be positive,"" even though the data appears to be correct.
* The system does not correctly clear cache or respond properly to field value changes, causing the undescriptive error."

----

* *Description*:
The newly implemented login screen of the Microtec ERP has several design flaws that impact the professionalism and user perception of the system. The percentage value displayed for ""Sales Growth"" is unreasonably low at *45%*, which can negatively affect user morale. Additionally, the image depicting an employee using the system features a *young boy in casual attire*, which does not align with the formal and professional tone expected for an ERP system catering to business environments.

----

* *Issues Identified*:
*# *Percentage Display*:
*#* The ""Sales Growth"" percentage is set at *45%*, which gives the impression of poor performance. This value should either reflect realistic, customizable data or be removed if irrelevant.
*# *Image of Employee*:
*#* The login screen features a *young boy in casual clothing*, which is unprofessional for a corporate ERP system. The image should be replaced with a representation of a professional employee in formal attire to align with the target audience and business context.

----

* *Preconditions*:
*# The user is presented with the login screen of the Microtec ERP.
*# The design elements (percentage growth, background image) are visible on the screen.

----

* *Steps to Reproduce*:
*# Navigate to the *Microtec ERP Login Screen*.
*# Observe the ""Sales Growth"" percentage displayed.
*# Observe the image of the employee featured on the login screen.

----

* *Expected Result*:

*** An appropriate sales growth percentage or no percentage if not required.
*** A formal image of an employee in professional attire.

----

* *Actual Result*:
** The ""Sales Growth"" percentage is set at a low and discouraging value of *45%*.
** The featured employee image is unprofessional, showing a young boy in casual clothing."
